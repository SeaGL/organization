If you see any behavior that you believe may violate our [Code of Conduct]() or make some attendees
feel uncomfortable, whether it is intentional or not, please do the following:

- Send me (Lucy) a private message on IRC using `/msg <username> <message>`. Contact details will arrive
  to you by email.
  - Please include:
    - What channel the situation is happening in
    - Usernames of those involved
    - A brief description of what's happening. You do not at all have to justify raising a CoC flag, just
      provide context so that I can respond. I will try to be in most IRC channels, but I may not be able
      to see the channel history (and thus the abusive behavior) if I am not already in the channel.
- If I don't respond to your message in 30 seconds, call the phone number provided by email.
- DO try to de-escalate the situation if you feel you can.
  - If you don't feel you can de-escalate, then don't try to step in.
- DON'T try to handle the situation yourself, or threaten users
