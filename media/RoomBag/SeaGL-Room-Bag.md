Room Setup
==========

The room bag provides a variety of cables and powered adapters in case
the speaker's laptop is not equipped with a standard size HDMI jack.

**Please return adapters and cables
to the Room Bag when the session ends.**

Familiarize yourself with the projector's cable switch box (usually
located at the front of the room under the desk). It will need to be set
to the proper cable to allow the signal from the laptop to reach the
projector.

Speaker Setup
=============

-   Plug house projector HDMI cable into laptop HDMI jack.
    -   If laptop doesn't have a standard HDMI jack, use one of the
        cables or adapters in the Room Bag to connect to the speaker's
        laptop.
    -   Several of the adapters require power. You can use the room bag
        USB Charger or a USB port on the laptop for the USB powered
        adapters. One requires AC power.
-   Using the laptop's display settings, either mirror or extend the
    display. 1920x1080 should be used with the projectors, but they
    *may* support other resolutions.

**Please return adapters and cables to the Room Bag when the session
ends.**

Wireless Microphone
===================

We have one Shure Wireless Microphone for use on request. It is equipped
with a male XLR microphone output (for sound boards) and also has a
camcorder 3.5mm adapter that will fit most camera and laptop microphone
input jacks.
