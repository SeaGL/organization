# SeaGL Social Media Guide

Here's some information on how we use our social accounts.
They're not hard and fast rules.

## General style

* Engage with the community.
Like and share when people are excited about us.
* Be friendly.
You're the voice of Patch.
Act how they would act: kind, helpful, and a little silly.
* Don't engage with trolls unless they're harassing our friends.
Then just go with a simple "we don't do that here" or something like that.
Block or report where appropriate.
* Use pictures where you can.
Picture are good for engagement.

## Twitter and Mastodon

Twitter is where we have the most engagement.
If you have to prioritize one social media account, prioritize Twitter.

* Be hashtaggy-af on Mastodon.
It doesn't have full-text search, so at least include "#seagl" and "#flossconf"
* Have posts for each item on the schedule a few days in advance and ~5 minutes before the event starts.
* Mastodon doesn't have a good scheduling mechanism (in particular one that supports images), so don't feel bad if you struggle with it.
* Pin relevant posts (CfP, schedule, etc).
Twitter only allows one pinned post.
Mastodon allows several.
* Tag speakers when we know their handles.

## Facebook and LinkedIn

We don't get much engagement on these accounts.

* Post major news to the accounts (CfP open, keynotes, schedule announcement, each day's schedule, etc).
