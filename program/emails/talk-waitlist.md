# SeaGL Talk Proposal Waitlist Email

**SUBJECT:** [seagl20XX] Proposal Waitlisted

**BODY:**

Dear NAME,

Your proposal(s) was highly rated by our reviewers but faced a lot of excellent competition. We would like to include it in the program but ran out of space for it:

* TALK_TITLE

We've sent out the first round of acceptance emails and anticipate some speakers will not be able to make it, leaving open holes in the schedule where we can fit your talk. This may take a little while as the schedule settles out.

If you would like to remove your proposal from the waitlist rather than wait for a schedule opening, we totally understand. Just reply to this email and we'll handle that for you.

We hope you will still plan to attend SeaGL in MONTH. There will be lots of great people like you there to meet and share ideas with.

Thanks again for taking the time to submit a talk proposal -- we really appreciate it!

Best wishes,

Seattle GNU/Linux Conference 20XX Team
