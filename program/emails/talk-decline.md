# SeaGL Talk Proposal Decline Email

**SUBJECT:** [seagl20XX] Proposal declined

**BODY:**

Dear {name},

Your proposal, {eventtitle}, was unfortunately not accepted for SeaGL this year. 

We know you put a lot of time and effort into your proposal and we want to thank you for making our selection process so challenging.

If you would like feedback on your proposal, please email proposal-feedback@seagl.org and we will share what we can, as soon as we get a chance. (If everyone asks for feedback, it might take a little while.)

There are many potential reasons why we declined your proposal that have nothing to do with the quality of the topic itself. For instance, it may not have been a good fit for the SeaGL audience, or it was declined because we're only accepting one talk per speaker. 

It's still a good idea that deserves more exposure. If you would like to share your story, we encourage you to submit your proposal to our friends at opensource.com as an article idea: https://opensource.com/how-submit-article

We hope you will plan to attend SeaGL in MONTH. There will be lots of great people like you there to meet and share ideas with. 

Thanks again for taking the time to submit a talk proposal. We really appreciate it!

Best wishes,

{conference} Team
