# SeaGL program committee timeline

A rough draft of a timeline for planning program committee (_speakers@_) operations for SeaGL.

Right now it just contains a chronological series of steps without any suggested timing ("3 months before conference…"). We'll need to add that later.

- [ ] Review speakers@ mailing list membership (Google Apps admin needed)
    * Remove dormant folks
    * Ask for volunteers for new members
    * `[TODO]` Write doc setting up expectations of duties & responsibilities for speakers@ members
- [ ] Establish meeting schedule
    * Nota bene: More meetings are needed earlier in the SeaGL organising process than later when most of the speakers@ work is complete
- [ ] Set up meeting calendar entries
- [ ] Define important dates for the conference
    * Dates of the event
    * Date CFP opens
    * Date CFP closes
    * Date proposers notified
    * Date schedule available
- [ ] Confirm the conference software is ready for this year
    * Right now that means making sure there's a new conference added to OSEM
    * In future years we may switch to a different conference software
- [ ] Run the [keynote selection process](./keynote-selection-process.md)
- [ ] Announce keynotes on the SeaGL blog and social media
- [ ] Prepare the CFP form 
    - [ ] Set open and closing dates and times
    - [ ] Add session types (lengths)
    - [ ] Add tracks
    - [ ] Make sure extra questions are there (under-rep'd speaker, first time speaker, etc.)
    - [ ] Test the form, for crying out loud, including confirming that emails arrive as expected
- [ ] Figure out CFP office hours/support methods and schedule
    * `[TODO]` Write doc describing CFP office hours and support methods and rationales
- [ ] Set up office hours calendar entries
- [ ] Write CFP opening announcement
    * Incorporate the [CFP instructions](./cfp-instructions.md)
    * `[TODO]` Link to past announcement here (I can't be bothered to look them up right now)
- [ ] Open and announce the CFP on the SeaGL blog and social media accounts
- [ ] Run CFP office hours
    * See above `[TODO]` about writing a doc about this
- [ ] Set date for review meeting
- [ ] Gather external reviewers
    * External reviewers are cycled every year
    * Gather candidates from speakers@
    * Select a diverse group, both in expertise and demographics
    * Invite however many you feel like (don't go nuts)
    * `[TODO]` Write a doc about external reviewers selection, duties, responsibilities, expectations
- [ ] Review reviewers@ mailing list membership (Google Apps admin needed)
    - [ ] Remove all members except speakers@ (external reviewers are cycled every year)
    - [ ] Add new external reviewers
- [ ] Add reviewers to conference system
    * Confirm each has authorisation to review proposals
- [ ] Send email to reviewers to confirm duties, responsibilities, expectations
- [ ] Close CFP
- [ ] Send [reviewing instructions](./cfp-selection-criteria.md) to reviewers
- [ ] Review talks
- [ ] Select talks
    * `[TODO]` Write doc about talk selection
- [ ] Create schedule
    * `[TODO]` Write doc about creating the schedule
- [ ] Publish schedule and announce on SeaGL blog and social networks
- [ ] A couple weeks out, email speakers to remind them to confirm the length of their time slot and that the programme committee is standing by to help w/slides if they want
- [ ] Collect reviewers mailing addresses, then send them each a speaker gift as a thank you

Aside from the `[TODO]`s inline above, some other things we should consider writing up…

* Tips for promoting the CFP
    * Speakers from past years
    * Ask keynoters to boost signal
    * Ask individuals
    * Some groups to reach out to
* …?
