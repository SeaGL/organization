    * looks like these can be comissioned for ~$200, Salt talked to Finance and thinks its worth spending on rather than trying to get a sponsor. Hans thinks the best method would be for the Outreach committee to follow an "official" process to request funds for this.
       * The official process doesn't exist. Salt's general unwritten process:
           1. Open an issue (default to public, but private if necessary)
           2. Assign to Hans or all of Finance
           3. Include in the request the amount, reference links, etc.
       * ACTION: Ben to open this issue
