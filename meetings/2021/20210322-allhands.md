## Agenda

### 2021 Mailinglist
- confirmation that everyone is on it?

### Date Announcement and other timelines
- Salt put out the announcement yesterday: 5-6 November 2021
- [ ] Blog post
- [ ] Social media
- [ ] website updates

### LibrePlanet takeways (including FSF?) (unfortunately, probably...)
- They used IRC and had a similar setup. They used LibreAdventure. Salt heard mixed reviews.
- Hans: I liked what we had last year. We're still in the top 1-2 for chat mechanism of the conferences I've been to in the past year. LibreAdventure had the ability to link videos from previous years. The Minetest instance was fun, lots of fun structures.
- Keith: It had a lot of annoying things that in-person conferences do (e.g. no way to contact people afterwards). "It replicated in person *too much*."
- Deb: The only thing missing last year was that people didn't know that they had the opportunity to talk with speakers afterward. It was more messaging than technical gap.

### How does the current RMS controversy affect the FSF being our fiscal sponsor?
- if moving before November, need to start asap
- Salt: We could be our own non-profit
- [ ] make a list of what FSF has control over, has their name on etc.
  - bank account?
  - storage unit
  - ...
- Nathan: We should move. We've had complaints about rms from speakers before. No position on who we should move to.
- [ ] Come up with 3-5 options, and pros and cons
- [ ] start a thread on 2021 list about re-homing our fiscal sponsorship. (Hans)
- [ ] Let John Sullivan know before close of business tomorrow, we don't know where yet but will have more info in 2-3 weeks (Deb)
- Deb: if we end up with a co-located event ( e.g. external group running a track ), then we need to include Code of Conduct considerations with an external group
- Sri: LAS reached out to SCALE, ATO and LF - and all of them were interested in having a co-located events. Of course LAS is a specific subject matter (apps) so might have a specific appeal.

###  task tracking tools
- Salt: still looking forward to doing this, would love it if someone more experienced could do some hand-holding in the beginning.
- [ ] document the new system, decide on onboarding steps, put into play slowly, eventually use it to run meetings, follow advice similar to https://github.com/features/project-management/

### committee structure
- new committe 1st draft: https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/SeaGL_2021_committees
- pad from last year outlining some good info https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/seagl_2020_domain_descs
- Ben: I'm not sure I like having fundraising in Promotion & Outreach, because it feels like a very different skill set
- Rachel: I agree with splitting it from accounting, but I'm not sure it fits Outreach either
- Hans: If we had to put it in one of the two, we should put it in Finance and have a person dedicated to it. But if Ben leads P&O, Hans can spend more time focusing on fundraising. Ideally we get someone who can truly concentrate on that.
- Salt: I'm okay with making it separate or putting it under Impresario, but it's just one more thing (everyone says "no" to that)
- Deb: This probably lives with partnerships, so this person might also do hustling of in-kind stuff and would have the expo floor when we do that again
- Salt: Ambassadors could live under Partnerships as well
- Hans: If there are places where the Finance committee and the fundraising committee should be separate, we should document that (non-profit entities should try not to promise weird things for sponsors, best path is to take "un-earmarked" funds and spend money on programmatic goals)
- [ ] get names next to committees
  - Impresario ()
  - Programming & Flow ()
  - Finance ()
  - Audio/Visual ()
  - Attendee Experience ()
  - Promotion & Outreach ()
  - Partnerships ()
  - SRE/Technical ()
  - Volunteers ()
  - IDEA ()
  - Code of Conduct ()

### reviewing feedback from last year's event.
- Need to schedule some time to do this async, hopefully using GH
- Wil try to do this before THIS meeting...
- [ ] set this up for asynchronous review, probably using github projects
- [ ] include reminder in email and duedate

### regular meeting time
- Monday at 5pm sounds very familiar. 
- [ ] include in next meeting announcement

### Videos
- Trying to get to this, happy to have someone else take over the trial of various transcription services
- [ ] make movement, or get someone else to work on, https://github.com/SeaGL/tech/issues/18 

### Speaker Swag
- schwag is at Salt's and needs to get shipped
- [ ] open/find github issue to track this

### Blog Posts
- [ ] (Ben) See the email for list of 2020 close-outs, includes more things, including many blog posts

<!--
## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):
    pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)
    pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):
    #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".
    javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
    - "^" approve, extend the timebox
    - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
    - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitatory makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
    - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
    - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
    - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
    -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
    - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
