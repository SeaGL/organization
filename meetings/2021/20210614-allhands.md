### Previous meeting feedback

- Christy: looking forward to connecting offline with finance to work on prospectus and talk about sponsors, thanks to everyone for being involved

  - need more people power to move it forward
  - probably not upgrading OSEM this year and that's ok(?)
  - this bugs Andrew a LOT
  - Sri will introduce Don to Kenny as a sysadmin type person
- Don: pains me to hear something so neglected
- Sri: glad to be here and help out, looking forward to SeaGL 2021
- Rhiannon: glad to have something else to do and help out with
  - (Don will invite her to tech committee!)
- Deb: glad we've stopped glossing things over in terms of OSEM and enjoyed the smaller group of people

## Minute of silence (get into the SeaGL headspace)
- Review agenda
- Consider tensions, progress updates, blockers, questions
- Gather personal notes, tasks, emails

### (Nathan) Sponsored Track
- Salt we could consider, but if a group wants a sponsored track, they need to volunteer for the event and attend meetings

### (Nathan) CFP Update
- fresh blog post being drafted!
- fresh code of practice blog post
- both should be up within the week
- spent time last week going through OSEM setting up CFP
- big shout out to Andrew to help with tech issues!
- seems good to go now
- put some redirects in place, need to remove them (e.g. OSEM.* goes to seagl.org)
- cfp should be out within a week or so
- Way to use parameters in posts to specify a {{CFP}}
  - Removing the osem.seagl.org redirect should just make it show the current CFP
  - Will also make 2019 post go to current CFP, but does that matter?
  - Worthy of new agenda item

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):
  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)
  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):
  #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".
  javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
  - "^" approve, extend the timebox
  - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
  - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitatory makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
  - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
  - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
  - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
  -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
  - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
