        * https://github.com/SeaGL/seagl.github.io/blob/master/fliers/2017/party_slides.key
        * Auto-advance? 

```
Procedure for having google slides automatically advance:
    On the file menu, select publish to web....
    There is an option to select how fast you want the slides to automaticaly advance. For testing purposes, usen 1 second, for production, at your discretion
     I think that for our purposes, check both start slideshow and restart the slideshow
     The textbox has the link that should be copied and pasted as needed.  This link is the one that actually has the rotating slide show.
     To make changes to the above settings, first stop publishing, then make the changes, then start publishing again.
```

* Salt giving the Cascadia award on Saturday
