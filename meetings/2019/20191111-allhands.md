- food, coffee, snacks, tea, etc status TODO
-- do we have a Costco run arranged? 
--- fruit and pastries for breakfast to supplement whatever we get
der.hans' friend? "bananas, oranges, apples and granola bars circa $100)
--- salad for lunch to supplement Hot Mama's order
Salad is needed on Saturday only, salad bags or boxes, cherry tomatoes 
$60

--- non-coffee drinks? perhaps a couple pallets of bottled water and soda, asking donation?
skip the bottled drinks

Salt will call in a day or two
-- we need to order pizzas ahead of time, how many?
--- $16.50 for an 18" plain cheese, $20.50 for pesto (my favorite!!!)
--- they have a SCC discount that we'll need Lisa (or other faculty) to join us for
--- in 2015 we ordered 30, is this still reasonable? Yes. 
---

--- does anyone have a good pail for donations? Adam's on this

- who is handling childcare?
Deb has been responding and is in touch with the childcare provider


- Order (or bring) list:
-- Blank tag sized stickers to "patch" upside down badges, no need
-- Hiring / Looking for Job board??? Peg board, white board, craft project, (can I get a volunteer?)
Buy a thing for the hall and get sent to
 Der hans will buy a big sticky noteboard

-- Pump for inflatable seagull (maybe someone has this and it doesn't need to be purchased?)
Prasket and Adam will look in their camping gear

-- Hot water kettles (again, maybe there are a few of these floating around rather than being purchased?)   Rachel will buy/bring, bring kettles!   Everybody brings tea this year.
-- paperclips to keep schedule/badge closed

- Reviewed last year's post mortem and pulled out some things, would appreciate any help with these
-- Keep expo hall / registration closed until 9am, have signage on outside for attendees
-- Figure out way to help folks identify conference staff, some sort of very obvious thing (e.g. different lanyard, bracelet, big funny hat, etc.)
Fluffy athletic wrist bands, 10? seagl yellow?
https://www.amazon.com/s?k=athletic+wristbands&crid=2OO0YQHNZL7SE&sprefix=athelic+wrist+bands%2Caps%2C208&ref=nb_sb_ss_sc_3_19

-- Pizza for sponsors first
-- Consider moving registration away from directly inside front door to avoid bottlenecks, no

-- Create, and post wherever signage is, a blurb such as, "SeaGL is free and registration is not required! However, we would love it if you visited the Expo Hall on the first floor of the Edison Building, get orientated with conference, and consider registering." Andrew will add a dozen of these

-- one with all keynotes in one place (Rachel)
-- room monitoring, the why and the how (Deb, coordinate with Lucy)
-- "Features of SeaGL" (including TeaGL) (Hans)
-- guest post by the live podcast team (FaiF) 
-- here's what to expect
--- TeaGL (https://seagl.org/news/2018/10/12/TeaGL.html), lunch (Unfortunately we were not approached by a lunch sponsor this year, so we are going to throw back to earlier years. Lunch will be held in the Expo Hall on Saturday. It will likely consist of pizza and salad, andadonation will be asked but not required)., childcare (we REALLY need to have a codified form for people who are signing up for this, I've seen at least one email with two children thus far, twilio's example from last year https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6gzbINbMf02nw39IFpQzhsJ0P_WWoCdf3GVWW8yj-bEkP3w/viewform), onsite stuff (probably good to have the simplified hours, for instance those that can be found on the Floor Map: Expo Hall​ - Fri & Sat; Coffee, 9:00a -9:30a;Keynote, 9:30a - 10:30a; Lunch, 11:30a - 1:00p; TeaGL, 2:15p - 2:45p)
-- final details
