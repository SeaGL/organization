## Committee Updates

### Program
Chairs: Rachel

- speaker info email went out (?), couple of missing things (...), take a look over for others before sending followup
- edits:
  -- minors are ok
  -- ONE drink ticket per attendee
- delay talk selection blog post?  maybe just post it
- another post about "here's what to expect" & final details.  can be cribbed from speaker email
- OLF report (hans)

Other blog posts:
    - One with all keynotes in one place
    - TeaGL (https://seagl.org/news/2018/10/12/TeaGL.html), lunch (Unfortunately we were not approached by a lunch sponsor this year, so we are going to throw back to earlier years. Lunch will be held in the Expo Hall on Saturday. It will likely consist of pizza and salad, and a donation will be asked but not required)., childcare (we REALLY need to have a codified form for people who are signing up for this, I've seen at least one email with two children thus far, twilio's example from last year https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6gzbINbMf02nw39IFpQzhsJ0P_WWoCdf3GVWW8yj-bEkP3w/viewform), onsite stuff (probably good to have the simplified hours, for instance those that can be found on the Floor Map: Expo Hall​ - Fri & Sat; Coffee, 9:00a - 9:30a; Keynote, 9:30a - 10:30a; Lunch, 11:30a - 1:00p; TeaGL, 2:15p - 2:45p)

     - room monitoring, the why and the how - Deb, coordinate with Lucy
     - "Features of SeaGL" (including TeaGL) blog post - Hans
     - interest in a guest post by the live podcast team?  YES YES - I will ask them (this is Rachel) -- you could even do a quick "interview by email" eg, "what can folks expect?" "Why do you like community events like this one?"  - good idea!
    - SeaGL Features blog post that will be updated (https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/SeaGL_features)
    - Final onsite post eg https://seagl.org/news/2018/11/07/SeaGL_2018_Final_Details.html

### Party Venue
Chairs: Salt, Keith

https://www.solerepairshop.com/

- contract signed, waiting for payment
- food/drink minimum is $2000, estimate for one drink per person is $900, drinks that people buy themselves do count towards minimum
- removed costs for food and food staff, so we need to order through an external provider, qdoba or indian sound like best options, but both messy
Deb, I think the indian is a little nicer sounding, but go with price 
- Minors may attend
- how to authenticate folks getting in?  The venue is a bar on Capitol Hill on a Saturday night, this will be important.
  -- rachel sez: make sure everyone has a badge?
