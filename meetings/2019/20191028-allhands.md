Salt sent me a nice, short blurb which I am posting here because I like it:
    

    SeaGL (the Seattle GNU/Linux conference) is Seattle's grassroots

    free/libre/open source software, hardware, and culture summit. Founded

    in 2013, SeaGL now features over 50 talks, four keynotes, and the

    Cascadia Community Builder Award. Join speakers and participants from

    around the world for Seattle's FREE, as in freedom and coffee,

    GNU/Linux conference. November 15th and 16th, Seattle Central College
