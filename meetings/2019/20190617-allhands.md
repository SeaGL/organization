Maybe livestream the keynotes 

Party venue - Keith
Two options  so far:
http://thesummitbuilding.org - approx $1000 not including F&B or bar
5000 square feet, could subdivide, 3 blocks from SCC 
can bring in ANY catering ANY drinks
Jeff's daughter does drink catering (is that the word??) and could very likely help us with this
Could possibly utilize catering from SCC.
https://www.solerepairshop.com - $1500, plus $2000 minimum F&B
2 blocks for the college, very cute
They provide all food/drink/permitting (as part of ^^^^ cost)

Questions I'd like to ask, can we get vegan and gluten-free food through the 2nd venue?
For both, can we get good non-alcoholic bevs? 
Check to see if they have a non-profit rate
Can we have a minimal A/V set-up?
