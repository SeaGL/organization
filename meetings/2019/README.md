# SeaGL 2019 Meeting Minutes and Template

SeaGL uses etherpad for collaborative meeting agenda/notes during the meeting.

Currently we are using an etherpad [instance](https://pad.SFConservancy.org/) generously hosted by the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://www.SFConservancy.org/).

We have bi-weekly phone meeetings generously provided by kormoc.

After the meeting notes are committed into SeaGL's Organization git repository.

## Meeting Prep

Everyone: please add agenda items to the pad ahead of time, see most recent meeting notes for link to pad

Meeting Runner ( or someone helpful ): Create etherpad page for the next meeting, populate it from [the meeting template](template-allhands.md)

## Post-meeting Prep

Someone: copy and paste ( about an hour after the meeting ) the meeting notes into SeaGL's Organization git tree
