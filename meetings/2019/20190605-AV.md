Proposed Agenda

# GOALS
- baseline: keynote, for rooms: slides+audio
-- difficulties: projector resolution, bryan currently has a solution that up/down converts to the projector Hauppauge requires HDMI at 1920x1080 only for recording
- stretch: keynote pip / streaming, for rooms: streaming (maybe one room at a time) OR cameras, potentially having a chromebook setup

# Handoff items from Walter - Keynote
- time to teardown camera after keynotes, plus photos of speakers, have someone else handling rooms
- need to get dedicated Shure A96F Camcorder Interface   https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/accessories/a96f for keynote recording
- block off chairs right in front of camera
- https://github.com/SeaGL/organization/blob/master/media/2018KeynoteVideos/MakingKeynoteVideos.md
- currently set for one person to do all of the keynote recording, was nice having a second stream for community builder award
- nicer camera or two cameras for speaker and slides

# Handoff items from Walter - Rooms
- old firmware was wonky, had to prime with youtube? audio had to go through hdmi
- couldn't tell if it worked without powering down and confirming file wrote to flashdrive
- latest firmware seems to work (could have been pilot error or windows installer flashing correctly), don't get audio from hdmi, but that's okay because we want audio from speaker not slides
- five total units, one is currently working, Bizhan has them
- NEXT STEPS: see if all of the others work as advertised after flashing
- NEXT STEPS: meet with Walter to discuss flashing process, must have Windows machine to change setting to audiojack vs hdmi
- if everything is working, still need to buy mics, Walter's idea is 
- if wireless mics, confirm separate channels

# Room volunteers
- what type of training do they need, what type of running around
- They should practice on their HDMI TV input and get familiar with sending output to HDMI on as many OS's as possible
- They should know how to hook up and turn on recording on the Hauppauge and the Shure wireless mics
- For the wireless mics, have spare batteries available

# Photo ribbons
- issue with filming of rooms/audience
- taking pictures around conference space
- people concerned with privacy are usually okay with back of head
