## 2023 outdated timeline

* March: staging area in OSEM??
* March: ideally, have Mailu set up (before CFP, or delay to well after)
* mid March: CFP opens
* March: "tell tech your problems" session
* ~April: venue information
* ~April: have "what does the conference look like" meeting. joint tech/attendee experience/etc.
* July: latest to reach out to PeerTube admins and ask if we can piggyback.
* August: plan for Hacktoberfest

## things to think about re: conference experience

Would be nice to have an option where music is muted during cut scene so that volume doesn't have to be turned down allowing an audiable notice when talks are back on. (feedback)


## notes for speakers

* if you're prerecorded, please don't answer Q&A during the talk because there isn't a good way to let in-person people participate in that discussion.
* please remember to check the Matrix room after your talk, especially if you have interesting hallway track convos after - can frame this as a, write it down/post it so everyone can benefit and it gets archived
  * good advice in general tbh



btw, we'll have two places we can rent tech stuff from on-campus for basically free, if we have enough lead-time: https://com.uw.edu/resources/checkout/ and https://stlp.uw.edu/ both are behind logins, but I can share their inventory if specifics are needed. also remember that we have five room bags with adapters and wireless mics for each. there should be an inventory of them somewhere in GH or Drive.
