- signing the public health pledge ASAP

#### CoC
- no updates

#### IDEA
- wilco asked the Disabled Techies slack to review the SeaGL website

- https://pad.seattlematrix.org/p/SeaGL_2023_IDEA can't be sent out until Public Health Pledge gets sent out

- unsure about switching away from all Google Apps at that same time because it requires OSUOSL to do some stuff

#### Volunteers

### New Items
<!--
#### TOPIC TITLE (PERSON)
-->

#### Lack of Committee Chairs
- Sending out Committee Chairpersons post soon should help fill those spots.

#### Review SeaGL Health and Safety Policy
- https://github.com/SeaGL/seagl.github.io/pull/392/files
- It is an open question on how this volunteer-run event will enforce CoC violations, including those in the health pledge.
	- We can make it known that someone is unwelcome, but we don't really have the ability to physically bar people from entering our area in the public spaces on campus.
	- This is not keeping us from submitting the pledge, but we need to have some discussions about this in general so we have it documented somewhere what we are willing to do and how it can be done.


### Open discussion (~5 minute, if time)

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):  #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".  javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
  - "^" approve, extend the timebox
  - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
  - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitator makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
  - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
  - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
  - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
  -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
  - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
