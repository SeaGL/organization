## Agenda

### 2024 Date
- Visual calendar at https://cloud.seagl.org/index.php/apps/calendar/p/fxj8N86RZ9rNMTJ5/dayGridMonth/2024-11-01
  - You have to fast-forward to the future months we are looking at
- Potential SeaGL 2024 Dates: 10/18-19, 10/25-26, 11/1-2, 11/8-9
- Potential conflicting events:
  - Ohio Linux Fest, beginning of Sept
  - All Things Open 10/27-29, Raleigh, NC
  - GitHub Universe 10/29-30, San Francisco
  - Halloween weekend, 11/1-2
  - Ubuntu Summit, likely second weekend of Nov
  - KubeCon 11/12-15, SLC, Utah
  - LFNW, likely spring
  - UW midterms likely first two weekends of November, instruction begins 9/25, ends 12/6
  - UW Family Weekend was Oct 20-21 in 2023
    - Unknown weekend in Oct next year, all weekends booked
    - Can we pressure this into being a different weekend by scheduling our stuff before theirs?
      - we can ask them when that day gets decided
- right now we are looking mostly at 10/18-19
  - 10/25-26 maybe a backup if UW is booked
  - 11/22-23 is also a possibility, but closes in on holiday travel
- 10/18-19 should be our first choice
  - if UW can't give us a go-ahead
  - our second choice is 10/11-12
  - this is all based on if they can give us a family weekend selection date soon enough for our save the date
- third choice is 11/8-9

#### From Retrospective
- November 1-2 or 8-9 (Friday/Saturday): SeaGL 2024
  - First date collides with Halloween
  - Second date collides with Veteran's day
- What about late October?
  - We've been 5+ years of this slot
    - this is nice for other events trying to plan so that we don't collide with them
  - 25/26 Oct (collides with something maybe?)
- KubeCon is 12-15 of Nov, Utah SLC
  - This was a problem for a lot of speakers and sponsors
  - Nobody wanted to do both
- GitHub Universe is Oct 29-30 2024, San Francisco
- All Things Open is Oct 27-29 2024, Raleigh
- Ohio Linux Fest is beginning of Sept
  - Was a problem for several years but has not been a problem recently
  - We can contact them about planning around each other
- 18th-19th Oct SeaGL moves it very far from our expected date
- Ubuntu Summit collided with SeaGL
  - was in Europe at the same time (2022 and 2023)
  - 2024 dates not published
  - Always in Europe
- LFNW 2024 is unknown date, unannounced, Bellingham WA
  - supposedly back to spring
- Staying hybrid makes it less of a problem
- Visual calendar at https://cloud.seagl.org/index.php/apps/calendar/p/fxj8N86RZ9rNMTJ5/dayGridMonth/2024-11-01
  - You have to fast-forward to the future months we are looking at
- Speakers, attendees, and sponsors did not want to collide with Kubecon and so chose Kube over SeaGL
- Maybe November no longer works for us?
- Salt: are these the only things that we care about? Do we really care about these other events?
  - Hans: We should look at our direct competition. Halloween is valid competition
  - Definitely cannot go later into Nov
    - too many holidays and end of year wrap-ups
- We have been consistent for 7 years.
  - SeaGL used to be earlier in Oct but we settled into our current slot since 2016 because ${REASON}
- By setting it earlier, we are chopping off a month of organization and planning between now and SeaGL '24
Oct 18-19th 2024?
- UW Family Weekend
  - they have large portions of the HUB booked all day.
  - There are other areas but we wouldnÂ´t have a good spot for keynotes.
  - Basically all of October is UW Family Weekend every weekend.
    - Maybe we go to a different venue?
    - Salt has looked. There are not that many options.
    - UW gives us an advantage in terms of cost and not having to learn new venue qwirks.
    - Perhaps UW is just pre-emptively booking that space and they don't actually need it and we can have it to talk about computer nerd stuff.
      - We can ask.
    - Family Weekend page says 20th and 21st, butts up against 18th and 19th
    - Next biggest non-Lyceum room can hold just north of 100 people
- Oct 13th is Yom Kippur
- First weekend in Nov next year is Diwali
- We need to choose a date where we can get a roof over our heads. Does UW (or whoever) have that spot booked for something
- when to start organizing?
  - usually take off month overlapping dec/jan
  - scheduling email mid-jan
  - first meeting early feb?
  - Still work on stuff in between now and then
  - No objections to this timeline

### Venue Discussion
- Should we go back to UW?
- pros
  - affordable(-er) than anywhere else
  - have an idea of what quirks there are
  - access to students
  - not having to spend time on finding another venue
  - hard to have this discussion less than 12 months out
- cons
  - big campus makes it harder to find venue
  - no nearby food on saturday
- needs
  - 3+ presentation rooms
  - expo hall
  - keynote room
  - should be accessible by transit
- possible to host in other building at uw?
  - probably have good contacts in cse
- if hub responds that they won't know about dates until past our save-the-date point, then lets explore other buildings

##### From Retrospective
- We should have booked more time for setup so that we could test things before speakers started giving talks
- HDMI cables from UW were sucking, in locked cabinets we could not access
- UW moves very slowly
- They don't want us moving tables
- Can we do something to not have to tear down the entire expo hall overnight?
  - We have to have some room for the whole day, then can pay overnight storage fee
- Need to book earlier so we can get the same rooms both days
- Elevator confusion, there were two elevators
  - Need signage to/from elevators on all floors
- Outdoor signs held up well to the storm
  - Signage on pillars went well
  - Door signs would be nice to have graphically designed so visually consistent and people know it's SeaGL
- Room bags were not in a great state before the conference.
    - In a great state now
  - Made worse by packing rooms quickly so things got thrown into bags
  - Would be nice to have better bags maybe
    - Boxes? Pelicans? Rubber-maid?
    - Stuff like this can get expensive
- Food permit.
  - We did not have this and so we fed people crackers and potato chips from Costco boxes.
  - Lunch was "there's a food court downstairs"
  - We did not have money for food
  - Not enough time to go get food on the Ave and eat and come back
    - for staff
  - Attendee food scheduling and arrangements are different from staff food scheduling and arrangements
  - Food court was open on Friday
- Would be nice if we had more signage to/from HUB from off-site or around the HUB
- Being surrounded by random students creates good and bad sides
  - Low trust society
  - We get people who don't know about FOSS starting to learn stuff
  - Drive-by engagement
  - We need drive-by engagement to exist
- We booked the hallway AND the chair lounge area
  - Did not use the lounge area
  - We could have roped it off
    - UW surprisingly did not rope it off
  - People did not know that the lounge was belonging to SeaGL.
    - Students just treated it like normal lounge time.
- Consider being hosted in CS building?
- Power strip tripping hazard
  - Better taping-down helped on day 2 for main thoroughfare
  - Maybe there were better outlets available for use
  - We could rope it better if we had different table designs perhaps
- Trash bins were supposed to be part of the reservation
  - Should have been physically closer
  - Venue requested us to request garbage bin service
  - Front-desk did give us trash out of the goodness of their hearts, we need to request this next year

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):  #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".  javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
  - "^" approve, extend the timebox
  - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
  - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitator makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
  - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
  - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
  - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
  - ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
  - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete

### Task States
- [/] started
- [x] completed
- [#] cancelled
- [-] irrelevant
- [<] backlogged
- [>] refocused
