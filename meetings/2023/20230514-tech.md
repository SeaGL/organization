Attendees: Andrew, Aj, wilco, Alfredo

Ongoing projects:
- MailU (high pri)
  - Needs testing
      - AJ and Andrew walked through the draft Mailu configuration and followed up with some of the outstanding GH comments. AJ suggested using the draft as the beginning of our Mailu role, and Andrew cleaned up the Git history to fit this use.
  - Will need a stable IP allocation in the long term, not an ad hoc assignment following the lifetime of a compute instance. AJ is asking OSL about this and rDNS needs.
- Vaultwarden
  - what to do for backup? (borg, rsync.net)
