#### timeline

- after cfp we'll have like a month to develop more graphics
- [ ] develop post cfp graphics, ~1 month

#### local flyering
- do we want to update the files with the extended CFP date?
- files are on the website
    - https://seagl.org/fliers/2023/
- [ ] flyers need to get posted around town right away.
    - and it's a lovely weather for bike riding
    - do you work at an office? post 'em up there!

#### chair?

#### cadence
- meetings weekly to get things rolling
- next meeting June 1
- [ ] set up calendar event for outreach meeting

### Open discussion (~5 minute, if time)

#### feedback on mateus template draft
- M: hi everyone! i won't be able to attend today, sorry, but i would like to know what do you think about this template draft:
- still with simple shapes. i haven't been able to add more significant references to the theme, but it's a draft anyway
- my original idea was to add something like "sound waves", i was trying the plot function extension in inkscape and this shape also looks like a wave (an ocean one)
- A: I like the dynamism the waves add
- S: the profile pic screams having a speaker/series of sound waves/vinyl record behind it.
- maybe doing a similar thing but having them intersect at the corners (unsure about all corners, half, diagonal, etc...
- maybe coming out of the dates and logo.
- add Seattle, WA to info box, maybe with UW HUB (hoping to announce this asap...)
- flyer design would be nice to pop a bit more, lets steal elements from the new cfp one, should be visibly appealing from handbill sized

<!--
## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):  #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".  javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
  - "^" approve, extend the timebox
  - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
  - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitator makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
  - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
  - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
  - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
  -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
  - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
