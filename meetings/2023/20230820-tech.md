Scenarios (TENTATIVE plans)

## Remote speaker, live

Pending the question we sent to tech@/HUB (see below): use OBS to output the stream to the projector as well as to RTMP.

## Remote speaker, prerecorded

OBS to steam the prerecorded talk to ??? from the room

## In person speaker

OBS to stream to ??? from a laptop in the room

---

Another question just came up in our meeting today - is it plausible (in terms of cable placement) to connect the projector to the laptop that's doing the streaming and is connected to the camera/mic? Such that all three (projector/camera/mic) were connected to the same laptop. To provide some more context, we need to be able to stream both in-person speakers and remote speakers, but for remote speakers, we also need to project the video stream in the room at the same time. So being able to do this all on one device would simplify logistics for us.

Also, just to double-check, there are speakers connected to the projector, right?

Can we live stream from the rented video camera in the Lyceum? Network connection, video capture.
