#### Programming & Flow (Rachel, Nathan)
- Keynote speaker progress
    - Experienced Keynoters:
    - Have sent a second email to Bryan Liles, since it's been ~a week since the initial email
    - If we don't hear back by next week i'll reach out to the next person down the list
- Extending CFP
    - Extra leeway since we're virtual.
    - Announce at current end date.
    - 3 week extension (Sept 9)
- Single Track? Two days or One?
    - Depends on amount of talks, we haven't really discussed, will discuss once talks are reviewed
    - Even if we get no more submissions we can put on a great conference, but we will likely get more, esp if we extend
- Honoraria not progressable..
    - No response yet after emailing them both johns at FSF in the last 2 weeks. Considering dropping the Honoraria
    - Deb will try to text one of the FSF guys (John S.) to see if he's seen the email

    - VM interview will be published by end of next week

#### TeaGL (Monica)
- Tea party for GUADEC
    - 12â€“15 attendees
    - during social hours, after talks
- Virtual concept from Monica:
    - exchange a la secret santa, opt in via form
    - personal tea preferences
    - consider current USPS issues
    - gifter revealed at the tea party
    - acommodations for people who prefer to remain anonymous
- Idea: cheersing chain video
- ??? something about timing/integration with talk schedule
- ???Yes to the swap idea, and schedule a little later most of what Deb said
- Upcoming blog post Monica will send a draft this week I can't listen and type at the same time.
- ??? Monica responding but I missed the beginning and have no context.
- ??? might have to get creative since we're at the border between a single- and multi-track event
- If not fit in afternoon/normal track, in afterparty?
- "do we want money or in kind sponsor or both for TeaGL?" i.e. what kind of sponsorship would be helpful?
    - ensure that everyone gets tea
    - estimated cap at ~$150?

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".
javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
    - "^" approve, extend the timebox
    - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
    - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitatory makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
    - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
    - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
    - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
    -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
    - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
