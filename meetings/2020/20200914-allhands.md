## Agenda

### Committee Updates

---

#### Impresario (Salt)


##### Speaker Gifts
- Still fairly comitted to trying to get custom answers, still haven't found a reasonable price
- IF we scrap custom answers, does a blue/white 8ball with the seagl logo seem like a good fallback?
- How many should we plan on? ~50 or ~100 Seems like closer to 50
- these can be promotional items in the future.
- keep sending phrase suggestions
    - 'sudo yes' ? exit code 0?
    - killall -9

##### Honoraria
- Email from FSF suggests that we need to be very clear that we are emphasizing BIPOC applicants but not selecting on that
- Having the checkbox about under represented seems fine, but we can't have one that specifies something about race (or other protected classes)
- may take so much effort/work, but feels less valuable when we can't be specific about the intention
- should start sooner for next year, can budget money this year for this effort
- [TODO] (Salt) update copy/date and LGT reviewed/merged, see if this is even worth doing
    - https://github.com/SeaGL/seagl.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2020-08-05-honoraria.md

---

#### Website & Technical (??, ??)
- Good reception from WSeaLUG, putting out more feelers for systems people
- Two volunteers to work on the Jitsi/IRC hallway track project, sntxrr and Tree
- for a/v: having everyone have a dedicated audio and video stream is very intensive, so we are trying to have a solution where only the speaker is streaming, and it is passive for all listeners.
- chat: "Kiwi IRC", a web client for IRC has Jitsi integration, with great indexing of the new chat rooms & data about these rooms
- new users can access everything thru kiwi irc, and a bot will regularly link to video happening at the moment.
- embedding video IN irc!  whoa
- backup is Hop-In, which we'll need to pay for but we'll get actual support.  for something this tenuous we gotta have a good backup plan!
    - backup Hop-In is that estimated absolutely higheset cost would be $1000 (but probably more like $200-$400).
- opening up to commercial solutions offers a lot of potential solutions, would be nice to consdier a free software product.
    - keith and salt have done the research and concluded that Hop-In offers the best feature set.

##### OSUOSL transition (Salt)
- No updates
- Ask Salt for Trello access
- Any volunteers to translate our wishlist email to concrete steps?

<!--
## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".
javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
    - "^" approve, extend the timebox
    - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
    - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitatory makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
    - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
    - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
    - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
    -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
    - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
