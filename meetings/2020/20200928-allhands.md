## Agenda

### Committee Updates

---

#### Programming & Flow (Rachel, Nathan)
- Program largely created üôå
- We have 5 keynotes
    - Do we have 5 confirmed keynotes?
    - 4 confirmed, unsure on #5
    - We are ok having 5, so we're confident it will be 5.
    - Vicky agreed to do closing keynote!
- Talk number discussion - timebox 5m
    - Spent time reviewing talks, did 2nd round review this week
    - 2 possible programs: 24 talks or 36 talks
    - Difference is 2 or 3 tracks
    - Regardless, great program!! (woohoo!)
    - Been talking with some folks, but have to make a final call
    - Only marginally more nervous about 36 talks to 24
    - Having people volunteer for minimum 2 talks (right now I have it minimum 1 hour) may help with getting volunteers
    - Then we have 18 slots instead of 36 talks
    - Any reason not to do 36? Crickets...
    - Some volunteer finding chat
- 36 it is!! Woo hoo!
- Get emails out to speakers this week
- No waitlist
- Thanks to programming committee! üëè

#### Finance & Fundraising (??, Hans)
- Need sponsors on the website, Hans is working on doing that
- Questions for sponsors (updating the form to ask how the company wants to be referred to: Name, logo, url, description, etc.)
- Reached out to some potential sponsors
    - Ada's technical books willing to have discounts for speakers's books (!!!) also will advert a bit for us
- Alison heard back from Indeed
    - additional questions from Indeed:
    - what makes the most sense for SeaGL from a sponsorship perspective:
      - a) cover all transcriptions
      - b) cover half transcriptions + bronze
      - c) plat sponsorship?
    - Indeed budgeted for sponsorship (see options above)
    - Does this all go to a general pool or to a specific service like transcription?
    - Not budgeting from one thing to another, etc. but we could probably budget this for transcription
    - We typically fundraise for the following year, so it's maybe more symbolic. If Indeed wants to be acknowledged for captioning, they can give us XXX amount of money and be the 'captioning sponsor'
    - It's really up to Indeed
    - Job board definitely a no-go since Indeed isn't powering it
    - Still need to figure out captioning stuff

##### Reminders

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".
javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
    - "^" approve, extend the timebox
    - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
    - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitatory makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
    - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
    - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
    - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
    -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
    - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
