### Feedback Form Review
- BBB, video of presentation area was large and person was tiny, only an issue in real time, not for recordings
- Saturday am keynote felt like an advertisement
- Unify the schedules, make sure up-to-date in all places
- Make sure timezones are right on all schedules, see if they can be reactive to user
- Did not find out about conf early enough
- Nice! Resounding success, minor challenges, etc.
- Speaking to no audience was weird
- Moderator didn't introduce or chat with the speaker beforehand
- Add interview session format
- Make it clear when the talk is live
- Add interview or panel session formats, even MST3K
- Pre-recorded talks worked really well
- People who opened hallway track or talks in separate tabs caused confusion (shh during a talk)
- Need more participant guinea pigs/volunteers, before the conference
- Suggested spatial virtual space like Calla (or possibly Mozilla Hubs)
- Consider adding chillout rooms, seagull art gallery tour
- Fewer channels, add channels as we need them rather than pre-populate (e.g. just hallway, not party/trivia/cocktails/etc)
- The !cr command was amazing, volunteers appreciated it!
- Everything was awesome
- Make sure people know that there will be a part where reviewers will see the proposer's names
- Make sure proposers know that they should write a real abstract and not just coast on a known name
- Warm fuzzies
- Sumana was awesome!!
- Yay, web portal!
- Thanks for setting up the careeer expo!
- Make the feedback link more obvious, talk about it more, extend the time it's open
    - We can still send this out in our thank you email to speakers and the thank you post on the blog
- Be more mindful about what's on the front page, update stuff according to a timeline

---

### Committee Additions
- each committee should go through how they felt things went and add any specific suggestions of things to consider from that context
- we will ToDone, bikeshed, or TwOntDO any TODOs, new TODOs should be added to the above list

---

#### Volunteers (Lucy)
- Volunteer | Speaker | Staff overlap:
    - Volunteer + Staff + Speaker: 2 (should I write names?)
    - Volunteer + Speaker: 2
    - Volunteer + Staff: 3 (1 was programming committee, not staff, but I think counts)
    - Volunteer: 7
- Stress leading up to event about getting enough volunteers, but not different than in-person in that regard
- Most feedback from volunteers was positive.
- One piece of feedback was about CoC enforcement, vol did not feel ready to manage/triage any events that might come up.
    - flesh out CoC responder role
- Lots of volunteers came from PDX/Seattle CoffeeOps (thx Lucy and Don!)
- Volunteer training went great (++ from Rachel - yes it went great!!!)
- Email listing each talk a given moderator was going to moderate for was SO helpful
- Big ups to Lucy for such an awesome job as volunteer chair!!!!!+++
    - I'll do that for in-person too!
- Add speaker pronouns in email
- Link to OSEM entry in the email
- Had a few volunteers that had some trouble registering nicks, could have gone smoother

##### Bikeshed
- [TODO] create an "onboarding" document for new "staff level" volunteers (regular decision making throughout the year, not specifically day-of)
    - can commit to doing this before next year's planning begins

##### Important Links
- [Volunteer descriptions + email templates]: https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/volunteer-position-descriptions

---

#### Logistics & On"Site" (??, Deb)
- A weird year for "on-site"
    - :D indeed
- Captioning discussion was hard, AI captioning got like, magically better and better as we approached the conf itself
- Awesome to be able to pass on Impresario role to Salt who did a great job +++++++
- Thought: maybe we could reach out to manufr & see if they'll one-off us a few?

##### TeaGL (Monica)
- TeaGL was AWESOME, great to have someone lead it, great to have someone manage the forms, great to have someone guide discussion both days!!
- It was nice to "meet" your tea partner during the swap
- TeaGL was amazing! It was delightful to hear about other people's teas and feel really connected
- The tea sending with anonymi"tea" was a bit challenging logistically, some people still didn't trust it.
- Make it clearer that participants can register multiple times
- The !tea bot command was a big hit :) so nice to move from alcohol to something way more inclusive & way more "SeaGL"
- Maybe Ada's Technical could be some kind of tea location where people can drop their tea off & pick it up
- The toast video would be good to have instructions for, a permanent home, and some other accommodation (webrtc with a record button that automagically uploads)

##### Bikeshed
- [TODO] TeaGL 'sweetener' for volunteers (aka free tea???) (maybe next year)

##### Important Links

#### Promotion & Outreach (Hans, Ben)
- Thank you Hans and Ben and everyone who worked on Outreach stuff - fantastic job creating assets and blog posts and everything in between.  Enormous thank-yous!
- Got good feedback about the graphics which were so good, thank you Mateus!!!
- Thanks Ben for writing blog posts!
- Great to see conference-specific images and headers, etc. on Twitter/FB/etc.
- Awesome to see all the tweets WITH IMAGES scheduled!!!  this made a huge difference, speakers loved RTing their talk tweets.  Lots of engagement stirred up from that.
- Schedule of blog posts was good, but lots of posts could have gone out a bit earlier like the schedule by a couple of weeks (note to Program)
- Would be good to get images out to speakers sooner (Ben: agreed. I used my image to promote on LinkedIn, my newsletter, etc. I'm sure others would like to do the same)
- Might want to peel out some of the people who are doing the interviewing or assembly for different pieces of information, from the people who would write the posts themselves ++ generally this is the principle of not having people chair multiple committees
- Would be good to have a list of people with their interests/skills listed, in order to rely less heavily on 1 or 2 people for certain things
- graphics were so freakin good
- outreach retrospective pad: https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/seagl_promo_2020.11.23

#### Website & Technical (sntxrr, Andrew)
- ALL THE APPLAUSE
- Live captioning would have been great
- Should have run through everything as a participant before the event
- May have been easier if we'd just gone through OBS
- WE PULLED IT OFF CAN'T BE SAID ENOUGH - Y'ALL ARE AMAZING
- People saying "I want this as a product", got questions about having folks work for other conferences
- Would love to see this more widely used - will we be releasing documentation publicly?
    - yes
- KiwiIRC amazing - kudos to Andrew!
- Some nitpicks with Jitsi - a bit inflexible, the IRC plugin to kiwi & the rest was pretty annoying, should have disabled Jitsi Chat, but it can all be worked out.
- Majority of users just experienced kiwiIRC stuff.  we didn't prioritize longtime irc users, but instead unfamiliar users which was a HUGE HUGE HUGE shift that probably brought in hundreds of users
- Still, we should have smoothed the interactions between other irc clients and kiwi
- Will be working to get stuff upstreamed (e.g. Jitsi plugin)
- Would love to see this written up on opensource.com
- Maybe having some of the committees so separated slowed us down a bit?
- Staff experience was great for this too
- Want live transcription obviously and we'll get there for next year!
- There was no testing for mobile experience
- Some pain for new irc users, but way less than expected
- Not enough tech volunteers, too much development work to achieve everything
- Higher priority on getting folks to help with tech earlier on
- One big flaw was how hard-wired we needed humans to be for a 2 days straight (Thank you sntxrr!!)
    - We can script much of this to be better for next time and not so human-dependent
    - redundancy is a great thing, let's work on it for next year!
- Gotta centralize repos/docs/issues for drive-by contributors
- IRC room counts: https://andrew.kvalhe.im/+e1mb787nbriqupxtach6bcgz8pcztfda

##### Bikeshed
- [TODO] (sntxrr) get osem hosted somewhere for Andrew to test upstream
    - It's complicated; work started at https://github.com/AndrewKvalheim/osem/tree/trial
- [TODO] (Salt) work on osuosl transition, get those with trello access the initial list of asks (keith, sntxrr, andrew)
- [TODO] change social account logins to use social@seagl.org address
    - [ ] (Salt) Twitter
    - [ ] (??) Facebook
    - [ ] ?? what other accounts do we have?
- [TODO] scripting the stream swapping
- [TODO] look into why seagl email is going to spam
- [TODO] verify how irc room creation from within kiwi acts
    - bot shouldn't enter unless bot creates room via !cr
- [TODO] (Tree) see if there's a worldlist filter to set a mute on someone, maybe for a length of time with a warning?
- [TODO] (Tree) add a link to help on kiwi irc somewhere in the bot, !chathelp?

---

#### Audio/Visual (Romeo)
- We have basically no TeaGL Toasts. We have what we had before the conf + 2. I think that brings our total to 7? imho not enough for a promo
    - it would be good to get some more toasts in, masks and other accessories OK
- YouTube livestream recording exists - audio desync, choppy video sometimes, people cut off early, volunteers video/voice in the talk
- BBB feed has microphones+individual webcam feeds+screen recording+slideshows. Also has in-between volunteer discussion that I can cut
- BBB feeds are difficult to organized and have long terrible filenames
- I know nothing about transcription
- we gave $20 to Kevin MacLeod?
    - Adam gave this money personally
    - SeaGL should give $20 officially
    - link to policy?
- I haven't decided a style for final rendering but I am thinking something similar to how DEFCON does it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzGwO5L9oq4
- would be awesome to prioritize keynote
- big thanks to a/v <3
- should have internal doc that links to each videos
- should link to "our" copies rather than the speaker versions

##### Bikeshed
- [TODO] get blog post together about our 2019 a/v setup and other conferences we spoke to
- [TODO] fill out [domain description etherpad]

##### Important Links
- [Homebrew conference platform documentation]: https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/seagl_techstack_documentation

---

#### Programming & Flow (Rachel, Nathan)
- Just a thought, maybe a keynote specific chair for next year
    - If this happens, it should be a sub-chair still within programming, but I strongly feel this should be deferred to the programming chair(s) next year
    - agree
- Estimate for when videos will be ready?
- Co-Chairs++ (strongly recommend for other committees)
- Individual speaker graphics/tweets were awesome
- One feedback (sorry if we're not there yet :grimace:) - It'd be easier to get volunteers I think if we had a schedule set earlier so people knew what time they were committing
- scheduling talks against each other is always tricky, harder when they are related
- Suggest connective intro/outros for sequentially grouped sessions

##### Bikeshed
- [TODO] review site for readability / findability of conference details, e.g. we're remote this year

##### Important Links

---

#### Participant Party & Hallway Track (Keith, Tree)
- (Salt) would have been nice to have matrix bridges setup ahead of time
- (Salt) we got lucky not having any spammers, should have a plan incase

- (Tree) Over-all, The TLDR is very positive. From my viewpoint I think it went rather smoothly, and I only have a few brief points.
- The SeaGL-Bot worked better than I originally anticipated. I overestimated the amount of user requests it would service. However there are many opportunities for improvement;
- But to mention 1 in  particular, was the hard requirement of SASL auth from AWS to Freenode that we hit the night before. However, it wasn't a show-stopper. Special thank you to sntxrr for figuring out what and where to host it from.
- I had a lot of fun developing the bot, and invite you to submit issues on github for feature requests and improvements, in the event it gets used again. https://github.com/treedavies/seagl-2020-bot
- Next Year I hope we keep the virtual conference aspect, even if we are able to have an in-person conference. This way attendees who cannot travel can also attend, and we can grow the visibility of the conference.
- I thought the speaker line-up was great. The talks selected were right for beginner to intermediate technical level, the speakers were fun educational and engaging.
- I had a great time, and enjoyed working with everyone. You are all amazing people and I feel like I found a tribe of individuals who share in my values and perspective on the world. :) <3

- reduce bot restarts (e.g. when adding volunteer nicks)
- didn't feel like there was time to focus on the party stuff
- would have been nice to pull in cool experience things like vr/hubs, https://16colo.rs/
- still lots to learn
- after party went unilt 03:30 pacific
- we could have set better expectations for hallway track
- hallway track setup was confusing for attendees
- we were changing irc channel topics by hand, we mostly was Salt
- next year, it would be good to have topics botted or at least pre-set
- we should plan after-talk flow
- perhaps point people at the hallway track for post-talk chatter
- nice to have less booze focussed events
- base party room that is family friendly, we set tone, can invite people to breakout rooms that aren't restricted
- should have had less channels to avoid splitting the crowd until needed
- more outreach to "drag people along"
- kids and pets !

##### Bikeshed
- [TODO] Link for the bot help on KiwiIRC

- Don: had a fantastic time, made new friends and put on a fantastic conference, fantastic job everybody
- Ben: thank Deb again for talking me into doing this, excited to work with everyone again for SeaGL 2021
- Lucy: could not be prouder of how this conference went, looking forward to 2021
- Nathan: we did it! another year until we can say that again
- Deb: we did a fantastic job, all of these new things, showed folks what an online conference could be, opposite of early virtual cons being very dry
- Keith: was fantastic, great job everyone, thanks for being super persistent Salt, despite constant concern about not going well, excited about doing it next year, hopefully with an in-person component
- Hans: second year to participate in organizing, even better! with all of the challenges we had, did an amazing job, even despite those, an amazing job, wasn't the same as scc, ???, kept it fun
- Rachel: kept telling all year will goto an online conference, but it's just going to be rough/dry/etc, but never actually made it to another so nothing to compare directly to, impressed by how warm/social seagl 2020 was, we all brought such a great attitude
- Andrew: highly nerve wracking, but feel good in retrospect, now begins all of the fun low-priority technical work

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):
    pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)
    pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):
    #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".
    javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
    - "^" approve, extend the timebox
    - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
    - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitatory makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
    - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
    - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
    - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
    -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
    - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
