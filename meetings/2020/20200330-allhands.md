## Metrics

## Reminders on best-practice meeting habits

- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- Audio notifications for etherpad chat available on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/

### Use chat in etherpad (and add your name)

### Conversation queuing

- three discussion mechanisms: hand symbols (below), call for a round (and vary the order), open discussion
- "o/" or "/" means that you have something to say and want to be put in the queue
- "c/" or "?" means that you have a clarifying question and want to jump to the top of the queue
- "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
-  ">" as an indicator of understanding someone and the point can be concluded, please move on

### Notetaking

- "???" on the etherpad means the notetaker missed something and needs assistance capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Feedback on new agenda template

### Serious consideration to virtual conference & logistics

(copied from Finance discussion above)
- deb: what info do we need to gather before the virtual meeting? could talk to ian and john of fsf. who else?
- rachel: xoxo but very different style of conference than us, but isn't usually until sept/oct and already cancelled, would also like to reach out to other conference orgs
- der.hans: if you know of FLOSS events changing, let me know, started git page to track these changes, send or make pull request - https://gitlab.com/floxadvocate/floss_conference_covid_changes
- der.hans: please include me in meta conversations/meeting with other conferences
- deb: meta conversation already happening on FLOSS foundations list, can invite anyone who wants to participate, also looking to get funding, different folks from different orgs about FLOSS and talk about a lot of meta

- other fall conferences are cancelling (with tighter TLs than ours but worth noting)
- to be able to put together logistics for this totally separately from an actual in person conference would be great.  that is, to devote energy fully to just one type of conference, would be great. +1

- [TODO] Deb to reach out to FSF folks about their decision & logistics, 
- [TODO] (Deb) add people to FLOSS Foundations list, Let me know if you want an invite; Keith kodi.tv, Rachel too, der.hans ( will email with address to use )
Oh! It looks like now you add yourselves, https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/foundations

- rachel: everything hinges on this, and invite list may be the same, hard to find time, so should have big focus at next regular meeting
- adam: ditto
- der.hans: having as separate committe, if we do get into it, this is going to have to happen, at beginning still need core people to focus
- rachel: maybe would be good to have small squad to come up with structure to present at next staff meeting
- salt: have small group working on it, focus for next meeting
- hans: may not need to have big discussion, but we should start having plans
- [TODO] (rachel, deb) come up with things before next all-hands
- salt: ditto, agrees, will make virtual conf the first topic for the next all-hands

<!-- Open Discussion? ~5min. if time (skipped due to time constraints) -->
