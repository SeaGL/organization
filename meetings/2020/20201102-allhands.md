- Career advice and/or resume review
    - Hans already has volunteers for this
    - If we do this, then after,
    - You might want to ask VMB if she is willing to pitch in on advice, etc.

##### Reminders
- post a TeaGL Toast :)
    - https://mastodon.social/@SeaGL/105054866809580731
- please read career guidance email
    ```
    Rather than a job board, we could offer resume reviews and career guidance.

    I started that with my local group years ago and it has made an impact
    for some of the people we've helped. We hold ad hoc counselling a
    couple times a year.

    We also had resume review events during BoFs the last two years at
    SCaLE. I was amazed at how many people we had asking for reviews.

    At the RaiseMe/ShellCon event a couple weeks ago, I got to see how an
    organized online event can work. I think it's something we can do and
    it makes more sense than a job board. Additionally, Lori ( of RaiseMe
    and SCaLE ) has already offereed to help. Plus, Jill, one of my local
    resume reviewers had a talk accepted, so she might be game to help.

    I would setup a Nextcloud signup form, so people can sign up in advance.

    We can either run one of the conference days or we could run either
    Sunday or Monday.

    As part of the RaiseMe registration, participants indicate what type
    of guidance they want, e.g. breaking into security, furthering a
    career and getting into InfoSec management. I couldn't help with most
    of that since I'm not InfoSec, but I did help with resume reviews and
    general tech career guidance.

    We could also offer a few categories and a fill in option.

    A goal for ReadMe is that consultants can review resumes ahead of time
    and already have notes and possibly have provided written feedback
    ahead of the sessions. That didn't quite work this year, but
    counselling still went well.

    Counsellors self-scheduled by contacting requestors and making
    appointments. Each counsellor registered a room on meet.jit.si for
    their sessions.

    ShellCon had registrations from 60 countries this year. Going virtual
    really opened up access.

    RaiseMe had 18 mentors and 4 staff. There were 72 mentoring requests
    and 95 sessions before the end of the 2nd day. More sessions were
    scheduled after the official event end.

    Sessions were scheduled for 30 min sessions. It was good to have that
    expectation set ahead of the sessions. We were our own keepers, so
    could go over, schedule permitting. For instance, I helped someone in
    India and spent an hour as I didn't have something else pressing.

    We would need a couple of private IRC channels for internal communication.
    ```

- please read facemask proposal

    ```
    I talked to ShellCon's mask provider. They normally have a minimum
    order of 120, but ShellCon ordered a lot, so he'll let us have a
    minimum order of 50. The masks would be $6 each, so we'd be looking at
    an additional $350 to $400 once tax and shipping are included.

    If I'm counting correctly, that would give us one for each speaker and
    also for the core volunteers who aren't also speaking. Going with 60
    rather than 50 would give us some wiggle room.

    They want 2 weeks, so we're pushing it, but if we want to move forward
    with SeaGL masks we can send them artwork and they'll fit it to their
    templates.
    ```

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".
javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
    - "^" approve, extend the timebox
    - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
    - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitatory makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
    - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
    - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
    - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
    -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
    - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
