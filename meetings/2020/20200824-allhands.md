#### Programming & Flow (Rachel, Nathan)
- 3/4 keynotes confirmed as of 8/22/20
    - More Experienced: VM Brasseur, Máirín Duffy
    - Newer: Kathy Giori, TBD
    - Need to follow up and get e-mail thread forwarded.
    - Very positive reaction to keynoters.
    - Campaign for keynote talks, with a custom graphic (headshots) with talk title/date/time
    - Need help with designing a social graphic (Nathan) 
    - Lucy has been recruiting graphic artists, and can target people for this purpose, but it's not time critical yet.
- Social Graphics
- CFP Update
    - But out blog post about new Sep 9 deadline
    - Share in your channels
    - Good diverse set of talks covering different areas
    - Gaps: no hardware, social good. Blog post will be going out about gaps
    - But overall a solid program shaping up.
- Threshold for hiring White Coat Captioning?  30s of Rachel's Track Thoughts (TM)
    - When is dropdead(?) date for hiring White Coat Captions?
    - If we have 7 talks per day, then that's 28 talks for 2 tracks - I propose possible single track
    - Rachel will start an email with some of these numbers, and the % of talks we'd really need to have a solid 2-track program
    - Propose 1 track (aware this is also Program committe)
    - Would mean declining more talks.
    - Just wanted to float this - not a decision we need to make now
    - If we have lots of talks, this is a more difficult choice
    - Easier to keep 1 track with smaller number of papers
    - One day of great talks and keynotes would be a great quarantine SeaGL - something to keep in mind
    - Salt - would like this to be an e-mail thread. Also, what number of speakers for 2 tracks.
    - Hans - could compromise with one track Friday and 2 tracks Saturday
    - Wants to back TeaGL time into TeaGL on Saturday
    - Nathan: Wants to defer this until we do the pass-thru of talks, to ensure diverse program (arts and technical stuff)
- Blog Post Updates
    - Post coming in day or so from Liz calling for hardware talks
    - Should also be getting two posts from Vicki with interview
    - Two interviews sent to Kathy, will turn into blog post

#### TeaGL (Monica)
- finish blurb and sent to deb, bounced but got to hans
- when active, will start advertising
- next up is figuring out how to host signups and what dates to start
- when will deadline be to ship tea to person
- process in place for drop-outs

<!--
## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".
javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
    - "^" approve, extend the timebox
    - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
    - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitatory makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
    - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
    - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
    - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
    -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
    - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
