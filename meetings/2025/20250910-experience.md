### coffee? make vs donation
- https://www.ebay.com/itm/286750221258
- currently have percolator
  - can get slightly better beans
  - quality will still be lacking
- there is a list of local coffee shops to ask for donations from
  - https://cloud.seagl.org/index.php/f/45812
  - bit outdated
- alfredo proposal of store with good coffee
  - not free, but maybe not too expensive
  - may be able to cover
- donated coffee needs to arrive in packaged/consumable state
- ideally prefilled airpots
- coffee 100% of the time or at key times?
  - morning at minimum
  - next priorties would be teagl and lunch
  - could have good coffee in mornings, less good in afternoon
- hard to estimate quantity
  - students coming by on friday
  - last year at least two cycles through 200 "cup" urn on one day
  - general seagl counting suggests "400 people over two days"
- [ ] explore options and bring back to ax meeting (alfredo)
- [ ] purchase coffee cups, creamer, sweetners, etc if we are doing it non-catered

### adas after party
- open questions: do we want to/can we bring appetizers? drinks? entertainment?

### inventory buys?

- make infrastructure map (map of all signs etc)

### signage location list
