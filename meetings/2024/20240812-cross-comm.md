- Partnerships: Robin

- Programming & Flow: Dawn
- Promotion & Outreach: Alfredo

-->

#### Attendee Experience
- met with the venue and were able to work out time for Tech testing.
- also were able to knock ~$10k off the price, with the potential to knock some more off.
- also we have a locked room overnight and can keep things set up in the hallway

#### A/V & DevOps
- no updates

#### Finance
- no big updates here. need to go through and close a bunch of GitHub issues
- a lot of the finance stuff is churning because of recurring charges going to credit cards
- Salt met with someone from the OSI finance committee.
  - concerned about SeaGL's sustainability given that we've had such a dip in fiscal sponsors.
  - outlined what we're doing to keep cost down
  - they suggested considering other finance streams.
    - specifically a paid ticket option and have lots of ways to get free tickets, but by default it would be a paid thing
    - Salt said at the moment this doesn't align with our values but we'll consider it.
    - no way we can do this this year.
  - apparently all budgets across industry have slashed open source stuff and OSI doesn't known when or whether this is going to change

#### IDEA
- no updates

#### Partnerships
- Robin is working on communicating with 1 other possible fiscal sponsor
  - JMP chat needs a discount to be capable of supporting this year.
  - So they have submitted as a regional sponsor, but they are not.
  - We will need to discuss what it will be in particular and work with them from there.
- where does the sponsorship interest form output to?
  - it didn't look like it had been updated.
  - Pretty sure it is an excel sheet.
  - PostmarketOS, for example, didn't show up.
  - Salt: there should be a Nextcloud form that also updates to a spreadsheet. we can talk about that out of band.

#### Policy & Protocol
- no updates

#### Programming & Flow
- submissions are closed.
  - 79. good. going to be enough for us to put on a respectable conference.
- only 3 tracks, works well in a couple aspects
  - not having to pay for 4 rooms
  - also our attendance last year was probably a little too small for 4 tracks so this is fine
    - Salt wants to talk a little about that because of the keynote room minimum. but maybe not, up to Dawn
- a couple submissions we got are quite interesting
  - want to do something with them but they might not fit as talks so might want to repurpose the keynote room
- if you want to be on the review committee email dawn@seagl.org
  - or if you should be on that committee and aren't
- we have 3/4 keynote speakers.
  - all 3 we currently have are US-based.
  - given the constraints we're looking at in terms of money Dawn is going to...
    - we've run through the list of experienced speakers and got 1 from that.
    - going to go back to the inexperienced keynotes list, eliminate everyone who's international, and go down that to get our 4th.
    - Salt: there's a person who I think would make a really good keynote given the current state of stuff. don't know whether they will accept. ???.
      - Dawn: he's ?? based unfortunately. cause he submitted. seems to be based out of New Zealand or there around the conference or something. indicating a live remote presentation and a non-US timezone.
    - gonna do this plan. at worst we'll pay for domestic. confident.
- need to know who the Finance contact is for speakers organizing their travel.
  - should I send them to you Norm?
    - yes
    - [ ] send email to confirmed keynotes cc'ing Norm for travel finance (Dawn)
  - ????? (AJ got interrupted)
  - if we can sort out a 4th keynote speaker fairly quickly and organize travel that's going to end up being generally cheaper. otherwise don't think there's anything program-wise.
- final addendum: if you didn't get the Pretalx email check your spam, might be in there
- Alfredo: might have an idea for a keynote speaker. UW professor.
  - Dawn: send me the name over Matrix.
  - want to keep going down the list of people we had first at least at a given point because the rankings were all fairly close. so probably worth asking people who were originally suggested
  - one change we should make: we should have a year-round dropbox for keynote submissions.
    - saves the submissions being made in this very short time crunch period.
    - there are good suggestions coming up later
    - we can even encourage people *at the conference* to submit
    - some people just aren't social media people

#### Promotion & Outreach
- no new updates after FOSSY

#### Volunteers
- no new updates
- just been trying to figure out how to do things and get around in the SeaGL ecosystem
  - Salt: feel free to schedule some time too. I know I don't have that much but happy to touch base
  - sounds like there might be a Google Drive somewhere?
  - Salt: I think I added you on Google Drive but we're also kind of trying to get rid of it. there's stuff to show you there. I can double check
  - Angel: where's the best place to generate a spreadsheet of the kinds of volunteers we need?
  - Nextcloud.

### New Items
<!--
#### Item Subject (item facilitator)
-->

#### Keynote room minimum/room allocation
- biggest cost is the expo hallway and the keynote room.
  - expo hallway this year there's a max we're paying so we're ok.
  - and we're not going to pay any extra money for the lounge.
    - didn't help us last year and we can still use it.
- keynote room is still booked all day.
  - has to be booked for at least 4 hours.
  - by booking it all day and changing it closer to September we run less of a risk of another event being right behind us.
    - but we also probably don't want it all day.
    - but if we do that's how we have it.
  - again min of 4 contiguous hours per day.
  - on Friday it's pretty clear we want that to be in the morning. opening keynotes, remarks, etc.
  - Saturday less clear... 
    - do we want to do morning keynotes or afternoon keynotes,
    - or do afternoon and then have a social in the keynote room?
    - Dawn: very much would like to do afternoon and a social.
- September 27th is the last day to change things.
  - but want to get people thinking about them.
- also setup/teardown.
- if Dawn does non-talk sessions, happy to do that Friday morning.
  - bigger space is beneficial for moving around. but can't fill 6ish hours.

#### Paid tickets
- tabling since we're close to the hour and we can't do anything this year anyway.

#### Go through open tasks from last year
- https://github.com/SeaGL/organization/blob/main/meetings/2023/20231113-retrospective.md#1113---new-todos


### Open discussion (~5 minute, if time)

#### Dawn availability
- this is the last time we'll be seeing Dawn until mid-September.
- Alfredo: Dawn do we have somewhere with the current accepted/confirmed keynotes? their info and a list?
- if you need anything from Dawn Matrix is the only reliable way.
  - will transfer things like the keynote info into a Nextcloud document.
  - should be copies of all the program/flow emails in the Nextcloud space.
  - will transfer bios in there as well.
- when will there be the meeting to get the final list of talks?
  - that was in the email that went out.
  - aiming for first week of September. not sure.
  - Dawn can't book anything until the 27th of August.
  - meeting *might* have to move a week earlier or a week later.
- in an ideal world everyone who signs up to do a review will have it done by end of August.
  - there should also be a copy of that email in Nextcloud (Dawn to double-check).
- don't feel you have to review everything since we have a lot of reviewers.
  - if you manage to get through all 79 great, but don't feel pressure.
  - better to have a small number of high quality reviews explaining your reasoning than a bunch of them.

#### When to switch to every week
- Proposal: not next week, but after next biweekly switch to weekly.
- Consensus is yes.

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):  #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".  javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
  - "^" approve, extend the timebox
  - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
  - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitator makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
  - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
  - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
  - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
  -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
  - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete

### Task States
- [/] started
- [x] completed
- [#] cancelled
- [-] irrelevant
- [<] backlogged
- [>] refocused
