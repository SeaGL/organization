#### IDEA

    - https://pad.riseup.net/p/SeaGL_2024_IDEA

    - the draft has a variety of groups at the bottom that we could send this message to


#### Partnerships
- csv parsing as the last step before testing and sending

    - robin and chance to pair on getting the csv matters handled


#### Policy & Protocol
- no updates

#### Programming & Flow
- we have a keynote!
- are going to have to extend the CFP for a couple of weeks, but should hopefully give us enough time to spread the message and have people submit talks
- Dawn doesn't have bandwidth for the foreseeable future.
- For people that do use the social medias, please do promote the CfP there!
- Not a lot of submissions now, many are likely to come in near end date

#### Promotion & Outreach
- [ ] print seagl fliers for toorcamp (salt)

- Good design, let's try to combine with Andrew's SVG one that includes more prominent date and location.

- update when is it (move to top) and where is it (add university of washington somewhere)

- https://github.com/SeaGL/outreach/blob/main/design/flyers/2024/seagl_2024_handbill_ossna.svg

#### sending idea message
- https://pad.riseup.net/p/SeaGL_2024_IDEA

#### blog posts announcing keynote speaker

    - we should write them in advance, but have them ready

    - release one every couple of days

    - start preparing the first blog post announcing


#### existence of a tracker for blog posts / outreach / socials?

    - not that anyone knows of

    - closer to the date, but not usually this far out?

    - AV / DevOps was working to create an actually usable local development environment to enable rando people to make PRs

    - (the status quo before was giving people direct production access)

    - nice opportunity to do some kind of blog/social post highlighting

    - Anyone can contribute!

    - Just run these 3 commands!

    - Now's a great time to get involved!

    - post would be a great opportunity to fill in the silence/lull after CfP closing / already planned announcements

    - possibly do combo "CFP is closed, there's still ways to contribute, try our new dev setup OR help us review talks"


#### Friendly reminder that we have wiki-like Nextcloud app (collectives)

    - If you don't like it, let tech know :)

    - Write things down so they aren't in your head!

### Open discussion (~5 minute, if time)


## Wrap-up
### 06/17 - New TODOs

Robin - venue price increase is concerning, new tea things being built
AJ - also concerned about venue price, will see how it goes, confusion re: how we're just getting prices given we reserved/agreed earlier. good to see everyone, had quite a couple of weeks, good to be getting back to normal and working on SeaGL again, 
Alfredo - time to step up and double down on the CfP, if people don't talk it's hard to have a conference
Chance - excited to do some csv stuff, will try to get cool people to submit talks
Dawn - pretty silly last couple of weeks, rest assured that Dawn and Salt have talked about how to get the quote down; we're not without options. Glad that we got the CfP out in a reasonable time, looking forward to seeing more talks. If you're interested in reviewing talks, reach out!
Kim - excited to see what other surprises there will be!

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):  #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".  javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
  - "^" approve, extend the timebox
  - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
  - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitator makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
  - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
  - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
  - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
  -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
  - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete

### Task States
- [/] started
- [x] completed
- [#] cancelled
- [-] irrelevant
- [<] backlogged
- [>] refocused
