### Committee Updates
<!--
Important updates and things to share staff-wide
-->

#### Attendee Experience
- No updates

#### A/V & DevOps
- Stuff to support launching the CFP is done / CFP is up!
- AJ limited in availability re: mailu, largely due to dev environment constraints
- Q: Dockerized dev environment for SeaGL stuff worthwhile?
  - Maybe not worth the effort, but could be valauble
  - Current workflow is for AJ to run Ansible workbooks against production and manually validate
  - Andrew has a Vagrant/Terraform/Ansible pipeline that we may be able to draw inspiration from

#### Finance
- Norm to work on the Finance in Nextcloud (modeling after TechDev).
  - Need to add reimbursement process

#### IDEA
- Now that CFP is open, worthwhile to reach out to underrepresented people in tech
- [ ] dust off idea cfp message from previous year (Salt)

#### Partnerships
- updated sponsors on website
- table accepted at FOSSY
  - Context: FOSSY sorta replaced OSCON
  - 8/1-4 in Portland (https://2024.fossy.us/)
  - Salt running an economics track, so submit a talk
- Google is our first paid sponsor

#### Policy & Protocol
- merged the h&s changes discussed
  - FOSSY has a fairly tight version we might want to move towards next year
  - https://2024.fossy.us/attend/health-and-safety/
- [ ] add h&s to cfp landing page

#### Programming & Flow
- update about keynote invitations?
  - deadline for initial batch was yesterday
  - no confirmations yet
- CFP has launched!
  - https://seagl.org/cfp
- new volunteer interested in joining this committee

#### Promotion & Outreach
- CFP has launched
  - have blog post to go along
  - sent out to socials
  - will keep posting every couple days for engagement
  - shorter timeframe, try to get most people during June even if we need an extension
- need to get physical fliers up asap
  - [ ] look into modifying save-the-date flier for cfp (kim)
- Q: Should we create events on social platforms?
  - Going to post with old banners and update them when available
  - LinkedIn: couldn't change the header d/t lack of permissions
- [ ] Create events on social platforms (Salt)

#### Volunteers
- salt emailed all of the volunteer form submissions
- currently don't have a mailing list for coordinating volunteers, we just have a list of old volunteers
  - don't like the proliferation of mailing lists, especially w/ our desire to move away from Google, but may be necessary
- [ ] Create a volunteer coordination mailing list (Salt)

### New Items
<!--
#### Item Subject (item facilitator)
-->

#### Emailing Announce list
- The very-low-traffic announce list would be a good place to call out the CFP, sponsoring, and volunteering (and link to the appropriate blog posts).
  - Also link to Matrix?
- [ ] Draft email for announce list
  - incl.: CFP, prospectus, volunteering, matrix
- [ ] Add the people from last SeaGL who signed up for the announce list (Salt)
- [ ] Send announce list email, target Friday, June 7 (Salt)
  - Sooner is better, want to send by Friday, June 7.

#### Prioritizing Committee Time
- Not a whole lot of us (trying to change that!), but some committees don't have assigned/available individuals.
  - Want the committees to ideally be self-standing / operating with some level of independence.
- Want to explore how to potentially get those committees staffed without burning out existing volunteers.
- Advice / suggestions welcome re: how to best priortize the time of those we already have.
- AttendEx will need someone sooner rather than later to ensure the on-site experience is good. Policy and Protocol is maybe less of a demand at the moment. Help reviewing talks soon would be helpful. 
- Shoutout to AJ for the Nextcloud document sharing initative.
- Chance suggested the potential of doling out atomic tasks that anyone can pick up w/o the commitment of being a committee coordinator
  - Existing effort in this direction, could always use more.

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):  #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".  javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
  - "^" approve, extend the timebox
  - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
  - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitator makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
  - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
  - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
  - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
  -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
  - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete

### Task States
- [/] started
- [x] completed
- [#] cancelled
- [-] irrelevant
- [<] backlogged
- [>] refocused
