### Committee Updates
<!--
Important updates and things to share staff-wide
-->

#### Attendee Experience
- we have the HUB reserved for november 8 and 9
- right now we have the lyceum until 11pm on friday (closing) and 8pm saturday
- right now we have four mid-sized rooms both days
- right now we have both the street and lounge
- [ ] schedule tech testing timeslots at hub (Salt)

#### A/V & DevOps
- been working on nextcloud deck
- top priority is mailu
  - [ ] schedule regular working meeting for tech stuff (AJ)
  - maybe reach out to prasket, he's interested in migrating to Mailu
- meeting with programming to review osem vs alternative

#### CoC & Health Policy
- no updates

#### Finance
- met with phyllis, everything seems a go
  - [ ] get receipts for AWS and storage to OSI (Salt, AJ)
  - recommended considering multi-year contracts (venue and sponsors)
  - pycascades has been having better luck fundraising this year
  - we still need to get started before all of the year's budget is spent
  - asked whether we are going hybrid, said many conferences are not
  - books closed on 2022 and before
  - had various suggestions for prospectus

#### IDEA
- no updates

#### Partnerships

#### Programming & Flow
- no updates

#### Promotion & Outreach
- had meeting with mateus and salt
- trying to get lots of promo stuff out by march

### New Items
<!--
#### Item Subject (item facilitator)
-->

#### Group Coordinators
- Attendee Experience: 
- CoC (Code of Conduct): 
- Finance: Norm
- IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Access): 
- Partnerships: Robin
- Programming & Flow: Dawn and Romeo
- Promotion & Outreach: Alfredo (interim) and Mateus
- A/V & DevOps: AJ
- Volunteers: 
- Impresario: Salt (but is actively seeking a junior to train up/replace)

##### Renaming "Committee Chairs"
- what about Team Leads? Group Leads? Something that isn't quite so...
- sometimes people are turned off from "leadership" type titles
- person who gives updates on the group, "source of progress"
- coordinator rather than lead or chair
- committee sounds a bit formal
- maybe group coordinator

#### Year 12 Theme
- https://github.com/SeaGL/organization/issues/398
- blocker for outreach
- voting link: https://star.vote/6cezxe3n/

#### Hybrid?
- need to decide before we start sending prospectus
- what is the level of resources we need to hit to have hybrid?
- can we set these expectations early and recruit for it
- what do we mean by hybrid?
  - most difficult thing was switching between remote and in-person speakers
  - if we were broadcasting entire conference, but can't present remotely, would be a lot easier
  - speaking remotely but not broadcast would also be a lot easier
  - remote streaming but not speakers is another options
  - big part of remote experience is being in the room to ask questions
  - can commit to mvp of live-streaming, resources permitting, will be fully hybrid
- before cfp need to figure out what remote presentation options we want to accept
  - ideal cfp dates may-june

<!--
## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):  #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".  javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
  - "^" approve, extend the timebox
  - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
  - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitator makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
  - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
  - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
  - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
  -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
  - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete

### Task States
- [/] started
- [x] completed
- [#] cancelled
- [-] irrelevant
- [<] backlogged
- [>] refocused
