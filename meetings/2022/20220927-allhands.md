# Agenda

## Committee Progress Updates
### SRE & Technical
- dokku update out for OSEM
- 1password request started
- knowledge xfr last year's setup into AJ's cranium
- github repo up for restreamer
- jit.si contact started
- bot creates all matrix rooms for the conference

### Programming & Flow
- Sent out email to unconfirmed speakers
- Draft blog post (https://github.com/SeaGL/seagl.github.io/pull/341) announcing first keynote presenter
  - has been reviewed
- more to be announced shortly after
- just got email confirming a talk, trying to figure out which talk/s the speaker meant (we accepted 2 from them)
- still having email receipt trouble for some speakers wrt OSEM/Google
  - probably not a huge deal for this year
  - might impact speaker gift contacts, may need to email again next year before CfP goes out
- will continue to ping speakers, will probably send out more acceptances

### Outreach
- Salt has been trying to get ahold of Mateus, some family emergency, no contact of late - becoming an issue
- Have probably missed our window for getting anything in print for the conference
- reach out to magazines and ask them to run save the dates for next year
- Salt is happy to onboard social media people to assist

### Finance
- Still trying to get in contact with OSI.
- Salt has reached out to Deb and not heard back yet. Ping any contacts you have.
  - not on social media channels ... yet

### Partnerships
- no updates

### Attendee Experience
- no updates, still trying to schedule the megameeting

### IDEA message
- we were able to touch base, got it to a sendable state
- need to get it sent out this week (Salt)
- Let Salt know if you have any places you want it sent


## Regular reminders
- We have **5** weeks. Is everyone ready?
- Invite a friend (or five) to the organizing efforts


## Previous TODOs
### 02/08
- [ ] invite a friend to participate (*everyone*)
  - Going to keep this on until Salt feels like it and/or we have chairs for each committee
  - approaching the need for help with volunteer wrangling and other day-of activities
- [ ] reach out to media sponsors and Ambassadors list about attending and volunteering (der.hans, Salt)
  - https://pad.seattlematrix.org/p/SeaGL_2022_Outreach-first_message

### 05/17
- [x] make sure you are in the https://matrix.to/#/#staff:seagl.org Matrix Space and https://matrix.to/#/#SeaGL-all-staff:seattlematrix.org Matrix Room (*everyone*)

  - Notify someone on SRE/Tech if you are having any difficulty: sNTxRr, AJ, Andrew, or Salt

### 06/14
- [-] begin impresario future proofing if apprentice impresario doesn't appear by 9/1 (Salt)
  - Salt is committing to another year, including transition to a hybrid format, but would really like to find an apprentice
    - someone excited, interested, has energy, and willing to document the process would be good
    - local to Seattle would also be helpful

### 08/23

  - we've got some opportunities for ads, need visuals
  - what do we need specifically, by when, and for who?

  - add your name if you specifically want to be involved and aren't in one of these committees
  - being reviewed from a tech perspective

### 09/13
- [x] make sure the current sponsors get their logo on our site (norm)

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):  #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".  javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
  - "^" approve, extend the timebox
  - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
  - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitator makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
  - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
  - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
  - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
  -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
  - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
