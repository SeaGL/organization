## Finance forms

The type of software: "case management", "invoicing apps"

Andrew would love to find something that's generic that we could use for other problems too. There's some project that's basically an open source Airtable.

Do we have a position on using cloud-hosted but open source services? Consensus between AJ and Andrew is that this is an acceptable middle ground because the biggest problem is vendor lock-in


## Dokku release notifications in #SeaGL-Tech

- An example has been running in #SeaGL-test. Do we want to move forward?

AJ: can we just make a GitHub Action that automatically PRs a version bump?

## Matrix room upgrades

- Synapse supports room version 10 as of 1.64.0
	- seattlematrix.org has not yet updated
		```console
		$ http get 'https://matrix.seattlematrix.org/_synapse/admin/v1/server_version' | jq '.server_version'
		"1.62.0"
		```
	- Do we need to wait for the ecosystem of federated servers and clients to update? e.g. Debian packages
		- No, only the homeserver hosting the room
	- Do we need to wait for protocol version 1.3?
- Use seagl.org canonical aliases
