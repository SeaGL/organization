Cancelled due to low attendance

## GitHub access/label audit ([#251](https://github.com/SeaGL/organization/issues/251))

## OSEM

- SeaGL:trial is minimally usable
	- Remaining items in https://github.com/SeaGL/osem/issues/29 aren’t blockers
- Test instance is struggling/unresponsive
	- This is surprising given the machine’s specs
- Production Dokku host
	- Ansible?
	- Domain names:
		- Global: dokku.seagl.org
		- OSEM: osem.seagl.org (FQDN)
	- HTTPS: Let’s Encrypt plugin
	- Security updates
		- Host: unattended-upgrades
		- Containers: `dokku-update run` (no `--system-update`) in systemd timer
			- Discussion at https://github.com/dokku/dokku/issues/1089
		- Dokku: Manually follow release announcements
			- Official instructions are “For any security related updates, please follow our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/dokku).” Ugh. https://nitter.net/dokku is less bad, but still they’re chatty.
			- The [Dokku Blog](https://dokku.github.io/) has announcements for *some* releases, enough to fool you, but it’s missing several so apparently they don’t update it reliably. Perhaps this explains the instruction to follow Twitter.
			- https://github.com/dokku/dokku/releases looks good.
	- Monitoring
		- Email notifications of systemd service failures
		- Uptime Kuma polling OSEM web endpoint
		- How should we be notified of resource exhaustion?
- Production database
	- New RDS instance
