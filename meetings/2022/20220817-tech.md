## matrix room upgrade
- https://pad.seattlematrix.org/p/SeaGL_2022_matrix
- we now have v10 support
- could manually upgrade rooms that aren't bridged to irc
- bridged rooms need intervention as outlined in pad above
- having pre-defined ACL block would be an advantage of bot managed rooms
- Upgrade now using one-time script, document script in new branch of https://github.com/SeaGL/patch

## GitHub Actions for PR updates
- https://github.com/SeaGL/organization/issues/285
- AJ claimed this, has any progress been made?

	- [ ] add unattended-upgrades to ansible playbook (sntxrr)
	- [ ] systemd timer for dokku-app updates ()
	- [ ] add email notifications ()

## irc bridge
- have problems running our own bridge may resolve
- no one with bandwith currently, but prasket may be up for taking this on
- for now will make #irc:seagl.org quarantine room

## rss bot
- https://github.com/SeaGL/seagl-ansible/pull/2
- we closed this due to GH Action solution above, but is it something we want for a "better" rss solution?
- [ ] request less privileged matrix bot account on SM from prasket (Salt)
	- need to select name for account, display name may be set to Patch
	- ideas: feeds, notifications, announcements, utility, integrations
- [ ] set this up once credentials are sent (Andrew)

## conference needs
- big topic, not enough time to discuss right now
- really needs to be starting as we are almost in september
- should we be meeting more frequently?
	- [ ] ask for best time from people who aren’t currently attending (sntxrr)
	- for next week, same time (Aug 24 6pm PT)

## Finance forms
- [ ] convert notes (below) into templates on GH ()
