## Matrix space updates
- upgraded private spaces
	- room version 10
	- not supported on all home servers
	- Salt's main client hasn't updated yet, still has Element
	- Staff channel stays at room version 9
	- those that can't get in due to room version, can still be invited

- [ ] Set criteria for when room version 10 is usable, e.g. actual usage of homeservers and clients

## Self host Matrix web feed notifications?
- merge an existing PR, and AJ runs ansible against existing infrastructure
	- potential future maintenance burdens
	- already maintaining DOKKU, this is minimal on top of that
	- AJ, sntxrr and Josh will pair
- [ ] Share access to Dokku host and instructions for Ansible deployment (AJ â†’ (sntxrr, Josh))

## Conference tech stack (single-track)
- Program committee has been advised that this would be best
- Streamyard for speakers
- Restream.io for streaming to Youtube, Twitch etc.
- Ephemeral Matrix server
- Jitsi server


Concerns:
- moderation
- DDoS
- ample prep time
- identify threat paths
- identify which of our competing priorities are most important
- issues with element front-end, how seamless the exp should be for attendees
  - we don't like that the Element fork prompts you to enter your password into a rando website
- expose scheduling info to automations in OSEM
- more integrated/helpful bot which could possibly help lost attendees, etc
- need to set expectations for what degredation occurs if you use your own matrix client vs using meet.seagl.org

- 2021 tech retrospective: https://github.com/SeaGL/organization/blob/main/meetings/2021/20211115-retrospective.md#sretechnical-donsntxrr-and-keith
