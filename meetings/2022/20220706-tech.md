## Matrix brain dump from Salt

1. Upgrading Matrix rooms
2. User permissions. They're a little screwed up. Even more so because of the IRC bridging
3. IRC bridging headaches

Later we need to figure out how we're going to use Matrix during the conference. Conference rooms and whatnot

One current problem: it's disorganized and confusing to navigate

We've got stuff just living under the public space randomly

Another problem: there are permission discrepancies

Easiest time to address them(??) during an upgrade

Proposal from Salt: bot is the only one with power level 100, SRE has power level 99 and we configure 99 to have full access

The problem with having >1 100 user is that if you have >1 entity with the same power level, there's a hard lock and nobody can change anything

We can just give everyone with 99 room permissions, the bot is basically an escape hatch

## Jitsi scaling
