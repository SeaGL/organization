  - Each committee should complete this task at their first meeting.
- [ ] reach out to media sponsors and Ambassadors list about planning, filling chairs, IDEA partnerships, etc. (der.hans, Salt, Ben, Lacey)
  - no progress

### 03/08
- [ ] turn retrospective tasks into GH issues
   - Lacey was going to take this on but anyone else is welcome to do it.
- [ ] outreach to meet up to exchange info / go over processes and make plans (Ben & Lacey)
  - Lacey will reach out to Ben this week now that she is un-sick.
- [ ] meet to fold over some volunteer role information stuff (Lacey & J)
  - Lacey will reach out to J this week

### 03/22
- [ ] Connect J and Lucy to talk about volunteering (Salt)
   - Salt pinged Lucy, will re-ping
- [ ] draft initial outreach message (der.hans, Ben, Lacey, Salt, anyone else)
  - https://pad.seattlematrix.org/p/SeaGL_2022_Outreach-first_message
  - no progress
- [ ] send message to potential groups for help with IDEA (Salt?)
  - https://pad.seattlematrix.org/p/SeaGL_2022_IDEA-first_message
  - needs more reviewers
- [ ] #246 brainstorm year 10 theme (Everyone)
  - some brainstorming has been happening, more would be good.
- [x] connect with Hans to schedule first Finance Committee meeting (Norm)
- [ ] consider changing title of committee "chair"
  - Is this scaring some folks away?
  - Alternatives: leads, champions, cat-herders, organizer, flockers, ???
  - Is this a TODO? Insight desired.
  - Lacey says she needs to downplay it because it implies too much. "You are flexibly allowed to call yourself a chair if you want to."
  - Nathan says flexibility is good because different committees operate differently.
  - Salt says Co-chairs to make sure someone is checking in and two chairs is to solve the bus problem. Wants to make sure someone has eyes on it.

### 04/05
- [ ] generate poll to ask community about virtual vs hybrid
  - there was some discussion last week but the poll was never generated. Who wants to head this up?

<!--
## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):  #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".  javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
  - "^" approve, extend the timebox
  - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
  - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitator makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
  - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
  - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
  - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
  -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
  - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
