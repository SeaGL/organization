## Conference tech stack

- We have fewer volunteer resources this year. Letâ€™s use the least-effort option.
- Options:
	- Hopin (or similar SaaS)
		- Other conferences had difficulty contacting for non-profit pricing
	- Repeat of 2021
		- Fragile, chaotic, lots of maual effort that would need to be performed again
	- Recommendations at https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/virtual-event-suggestions-for-open-source-communities/
- Concerns:
	- Live presentations
	- Pre-recorded presentations
	- Live audience interaction
	- Live audience interaction following a pre-recorded presentation
	- Public live streaming
	- Video recording and export
	- Hallway track
	- Ad-hoc breakout rooms
	- Group social events
	- Ease of access, minimize registration
	- Pseudonymous attendance
	- Moderation
	- Resiliance to DDoS
