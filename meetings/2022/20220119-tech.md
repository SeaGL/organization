# Services
## mailing lists
- would like to use mailman3 but if centralized to 2 instance that's fine
- would have both public/private lists
- would need to migrate lists from google-groups
- some of our current email aliases, could probably be converted to lists
	- q: is there any way to send out "as" the list alias?


## email accounts
- need smtp forwarding for a number of users (e.g., all of staff) and apps (e.g., cfp confirmation)
- q: imap vs alias-forwarding for individual accounts?
	- we would have to track who has accounts ourselves


## groupware
### calendaring
- what is the best way to handle this?

### file hosting / collaborative documents
- nextcloud?
- hedgedoc
- ???

### shared credentials
- vaultwarden?
- shared keepass db?
- ???


## conference planning
### osem
- Rails app
	- deployment specifics unknown, probably Docker? Dokku? something though GitHub Actions? I donâ€™t have any experience with this, especially with doing it by hand (people set it up through Apache??)
- PostgreSQL
- Outgoing mail

### irc/matrix bot
- small node app
- increased use during conference
- probably well-suited for a Docker host


## during-conference services
### ephemeral Synapse (or Dendrite?) instance
- probably setup using [ansible script](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy)

### video hosting instance
- jitsi for interactive
- BBB(?) for presentation
- restreamer pipeline
- peertube(?) for video hosting/streaming
- scales up during conference


## testing platform
- docker host / ssh access without root?
- push to deploy services?
	- heroku-esque?
	- https://dokku.com/
- ability to run testing instance of osem


## devops services
- uptime monitoring
- DMARC monitoring?


# Migration
- q: is there a google tool to easily move everyone at once?
- q: what about sneaky meta data? (e.g., file version history, last edit date)
- we currently have 44 mail accounts, but about half can be gotten rid of or turned into mailing lists
- we current have 28 mailing lists, some with multiple aliases
- we curerntly use AWS as our DNS registrar
