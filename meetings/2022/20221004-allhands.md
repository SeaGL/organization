# Agenda

## Committee Progress Updates
### SRE & Technical
- we've started shutting down unused Gmail accounts to reduce costs before we move off Google completely, and Salt will tell you about this.
- also we are working out what exactly the Matrix experience will be like for attendees - right now it's looking like we're going to basically market a separate experience for anonymous conference access vs. using an existing Matrix account,
- and we're playing with some draft language to communicate this, as a blog post, clearly to attendees so they have a good onboarding experience

### Programming & Flow
- Not a lot to share except post wasn't posted so will post shortly followed by another post.
- [ ] need to ping keynote speakers for blog posts (Nathan)

### Outreach
- Met for first time in a while. Top priorities are the ads followed by a post about the theme.
- Let us know if you have asks for the content.
- Is programming going to need assistance for the speaker social media call outs?
  - Nathan thinks the automated process should work again
- Can tech look into mastodon/twitter crossposting, relying on twit's scheduled stuff and xpost it to mastodon?
  - [ ] look into hosting a twitter -> mastodon auto poster (tech)

### Finance
- Still waiting on response from OSI, have tried multiple ways to contact them
  - there was a feble attempt but it didn't pan out.
  - tried multiple escellation paths.
- Finally sent another email (that Norm found in Drafts).
  - "We need to be able to process money!"
  - got an out of office response, will try with another address
- Need OSI so people can pay us and so we can pay people
- Nothing new from indeed, wanted to know what we're doing with personal data but we don't have that.

### Partnerships
- no updates.

### Attendee Experience
- ball went thud. Trying to catch up in tech but another meeting will be needed.

### IDEA message

## Meeting best-practices and discussion mechanisms
- Review previous meeting notes especially when absent!
- During meeting, use chat in etherpad (and add your name).

### Etherpad usage
- Use chat in etherpad (usually on right side), add your name and set a distinct color
- Audio notifications on Firefox via https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notification-sound/
- You can hide popups with these ad blocker cosmetic filters (e.g. via uBlock Origin):  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(Email subscription)  pad.sfconservancy.org##.popup:has-text(/Delay before deletion.*\d{2}[\d.]* days/)
- You can widen the chat pane with these user styles (e.g. via Stylus):  #editorcontainerbox .sticky-container { width: 50ch; }
- Bookmarklet to make the chat bar wider. Select the whole line below starting with "javascript:" and drag to bookmarks bar. Adjust the width in pixels by changing "280".  javascript:(function () { const width='280'; const box = document.querySelector('div#chatbox'); if (box) { box.style.cssText=box.style.cssText+' width: '+width+'px !important;'; } const pad = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.document.querySelector('body#innerdocbody.innerdocbody'); if (pad) { pad.style.width=(document.body.clientWidth-width-50)+"px"; } })();

### Notetaking
- "???" means that something was missed in the notes, please assist capturing what was said
- aim for shorthand / summary / key points (not transcript)

### Agenda topics
- Each topic facilitated by topic lead with main facilitator help
- For topics that are not committee specific, add to Current or Late section and specify your name
- As needed, ping folks on IRC, email, or elsewhere to read over items in advance, ideally before the day of the meeting

### Timeboxing
- timebox each topic, rounded to nearest 5min., settled during agenda confirmation
- at topic beginning, convert the :mm to expected end time
- at timebox end, "thumb polls" may add 5 minutes at a time
- hand symbols
  - "^" approve, extend the timebox
  - "v" disagree, move onto the next topic
  - "." neutral

### Discussion mechanisms
- open discussion
- call for a round ("pass the mic" style, facilitator makes sure no one is skipped)
- hand symbol queuing
  - "o/" or "/" means you have something to say and puts you in the queue
  - "c/" or "?" means you have a clarifying question and jumps you to the top of the queue
  - "d" means thumbs up, encouragement, agreement, etc.
  -  ">" means you understand someone's point and want them to move on
  - "d>" means you feel the agenda item discussion is complete
