# Streamyard Documentation
This document explains how to set up the stream with the speaker on Streamyard for a talk at SeaGL 2021.

1. Click Blue Create Broadcast button
2. You will be prompted to select where to broadcast to. Click the 'R' icon for restream.io
3. Name the broadcast
4. Click the invite button on the bottom toolbar. You will be shown a link to share with the speaker
5. Hover over the video box of yourself at the bottom and click 'Add to stream'. You must click on add to stream for both yourself and the speaker before you will be able to communicate.
6. Click the 'Share' icon to the left of 'Invite' to add slides or a video. If those things are located on the speaker's computer they have the same icon to click.
7. Adjust the views by clicking the icons just above the participant boxes used to add them to stream.
  The view with a single speaker next to the screen share/video defaults to showing the host next to it. This will be replaced by the second participant's video as soon as you remove yourself from the stream. If you want to force it to display a particular participant in that view select the multiple participant view to the left, place the participant you want in the large view by dragging their video over it, and then when you switch back Streamyard will use their video next to the screen share/video.
8. Click on 'Private Chat' on the bar all the way on the right. This will be how you can communicate with the speaker during the talk (to give time warnings if they desire).
9. Point out the chat box on the right to the speaker. They can select between 'Private chat' and 'Comments' at the top of the box. It should be on chat by default.
10. Tell the speaker that they will see a red 'LIVE' icon in the top left of the stream when it has gone live.
11. Remove yourself from the stream, and click on the blue 'Go Live' button in the top right. It will ask for a second confirmation before going live.
12. At the end, click the red 'End Broadcast' button in the top right. Once the broadcast has ended you cannot restart it (This may just be the test account I was using?).
