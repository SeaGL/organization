Somewhere along their educational journey, girls and people of color who initially were interested in STEM are no longer considering it as a career choice. Aarti Ramkrishna is an award-winning educator from the state of Oregon; who is building equity focused classroom curricula for school districts from Kindergarten - 5th grade. While building this curriculum, Aarti will discuss her observations of children and adults and how racism and misogyny permeates education and why there is a leaky pipeline that blocks potential amazing humans from entering or thriving in STEM. Be prepared for a powerful emotional journey from an expert in DEI.</p>"

While you can quickly build your own CDN edge using the popular open source software, there are limitations and corner use cases, which lead nearly every CDN at some point to deep modifications of Nginx and writing their own XDP- or DPDK-based software.</p><p>Tempesta FW is an open source hybrid of an HTTPS accelerator and firewall, which was designed specifically for the CDN use cases. Tempesta FW is built into the Linux TCP/IP stack, so it perfectly integrates with Linux netfilter to provide multi-layer firewalling rules.

However, it also has its own limitations and it should be integrated with other open source software to to get the most powerful CDN edges.</p>"

However, there are few more effective ways to learn something well than to play with it. Even up until the point that it breaks. Within programmers, there is a odd nexus where such concepts as esoteric languages, polyglot programs, and “code golfing” meet, cross over, and become horribly yet fascinatingly entangled. These pursuits, which strike many outsiders as intrinsically useless, instead reveal what happens when programming becomes, like art, an activity that is pursued for its own sake, and the ridiculous becomes the highest good. If you don’t know how to program but want a deeper glimpse into the minds of those who do, then this talk is for you.</p>"

Collett,,,,English,Finding the right tools for your new job,"<p>Mobility is a natural part of working in technology. As well as career changers from outside the industry, people frequently move between generalist and specialist roles, or switch to emerging areas such as DevOps and machine learning. Just as a blender makes a different kind of smoothie to a food processor, your choice of technical tools should depend on the type of job that you’re doing.</p><p>All projects involve some degree of uncertainty, no matter how effective the planning phase is. However, one advantage of having experience outside of your current job is that you can bring different frameworks, methodologies, and thought processes to the table. Contributing to open-source software, and involvement in the FOSS community, can be a valuable source of knowledge on ways of working, particularly when you’re working for an organisation that’s on a budget. However, it can be difficult to know how to translate that expertise into a commercial environment, or one where open-source isn’t valued.</p><p>So how do we apply lessons from the open-source world at non-FOSS companies? What kinds of questions should we ask to determine the best way to solve problems, and how can we use our expertise to recover from process-induced failure? From latkes to licenses to full-stack applications, let’s break down some different ways to build structures that support us in getting our jobs done.</p>"

It sometimes feels like FOSS non-profits are re-inventing the wheel with regards to tasks like outreach, volunteer recruitment and retention, community governance and strategic planning.

Maybe you don’t think delegating is for you? New delegators might be tempted to delegate without documenting or without providing context.

The collective action model applies given the nature of provisioning—open source software is non-excludable and non-rivalry (Hippel &amp; Krogh, 2003). Individual contributors author software or code that they and the public at large have free access to utilize as they see fit, while the group can use the software or code without contributing. Given the non-excludability of open source software, this creates free riders—those who benefit from that good on equal terms with those who contribute (Hardin &amp; Cullity, 2003).</p><p>As OSS has gained usage momentum beyond small bands of individual contributors into the masses at large, the need to understand how maintainable motivation for those contributors works.

It is not always feasible to bring software freedom to the table in a country with low digital literacy and major political conflicts. For years, we have defined the problem and come up with some possible solutions, such as inviting already politicised groups to our movement and explaining software freedom in terms of their struggles, that may help other local communities too. Additionally, the Q&amp;A section will allow the audience to share their struggles and discuss possible solutions. The goal of this talk is to help other local communities find possible reasons for their struggles, to show that these struggles are not specific to them, to give them some ideas about possible solutions, and to be inspired by suggestions of the audience.</p>"
