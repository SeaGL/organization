You also trust them in ways you may not even realize: to patch their infrastructure against the latest threats, to keep your data in the right country, and to only access it in legally compliant ways.</p><p>What if you didn’t have to trust them? What if you could audit the integrity of their systems at any time, isolate your work from cloud admins, and guarantee your data is processed only when and where you want? Sounds good, right?</p><p>With new hardware coming online in all major cloud providers, <i>Confidential Computing</i> promises to alter the trust relationship between cloud provider and consumer. However, the tech stack is still young, and it is not integrated in cloud-native scenarios (containers) yet.</p><p>In this session, Aeva Black will present a vision towards this goal, introduce a few open source projects which facilitate it, and point interested developers towards community-led projects actively working on building this technology.</p>"

Conversely, ignoring community health leads to poor – sometimes catastrophic – outcomes for technical projects, and ultimately an increase in business risk in your software supply chain.</p><p>In this talk, Aeva will discuss what it means to shape an open source community through a values-driven approach to leadership, and provide concrete suggestions for open source projects and their corporate sponsors to implement which can improve community health and diversity. These suggestions will be based on real examples, though all identifying details will be anonymized to maintain the confidentiality of those involved.</p>"

Both the term “Free Software” and the common acronym FLOSS (<em>Free / Libre / Open Source Software</em>) are limited to software programs. So, we use the broader term <strong>FLO</strong> to bring our ethical and creative values to a wide range of other areas. FLO values matter in hardware, science and medicine, governance, music and art, and many other domains.</p><p>FLO is about people, communities, and cultures rather than about the products themselves. As Cory Doctorow emphasizes, <em>information</em> doesn’t want to be free, <em>people</em> want to be free. That’s why the FLO movement emphasizes people-first principles. FLO encompasses more than licensing and source availability. The FLO world that we wish to see is one in which all of us are both legally and <em>practically</em> able to use, study, adapt, and share creative resources in <em>all</em> the different facets of our lives.</p><p>This session will address why FLO matters as a term as well as a movement. The discussion will be facilitated by three FLO advocates who have experience with hardware and (FLOSS) software, community development, music education and performance, fundraising, and beyond. The audience is invited to participate via a live dialog while we explore getting ‘into the FLO’.</p>"

The internet is a single wire that delivers free speech, free assembly, education, family life, romance, parenting, employment, access to politics and civics, to tools and ideas, to community and the public sphere.</p><p>And yet, technological self-determination is farther away than ever. Open source means nothing without software freedom (who cares if you can see the source to applications whose essential cloud components you can’t modify?). Interoperability is criminalized in new ways every day. A single corporate account termination can cost you your media, your email archives, your mobile device, and even brick your thermostat and doorbell.</p><p>Time is running out to seize the means of computation and safeguard the power of tech to give us more control over our lives.</p>"

Relational databases are strictly structured systems to store data with many types of data checks to make sure the data meets rigorous formatting standard. Most databases now allow you to store that free form data in their structured framework. So how do you check that free form data for things like required fields, proper data types, and that the data is within a pre-set range? The wonderful folks at JSON-Schmea.org have devised a way to do all that and we will look at how MySQL implemented their templating system to verify that you JSON document going into your relational database meets your criteria.</p>"

Collett,,,English,Free Security for Open-Source Projects,"<p>Security is an integral part of software development. And yet, without a red team or a security budget, securing a non-commercial FOSS project can seem daunting. If you publish a package that has downstream dependencies, then any security issues can have wide-ranging impact. Even for standalone software, it can be hard to know where to start.</p><p>In order to secure an application end-to-end, you need to understand several different aspects of the pipeline. While theft of personal data is a very common concern for closed-source projects, open-source projects may be more at risk of malicious code being distributed due to a token compromise, or security issues in upstream dependencies. Fortunately, if you know where to look, there are lots of free security tools for open-source software. Some of these tools are open-source themselves, and others are free for use in open-source projects. In addition, depending on how your project is managed and hosted, you can abstract some aspects of security away by using platforms with built-in tooling.</p><p>In this talk, we’ll discuss the basics of security at scale (and on a budget) in open-source projects, and look at the differences between security for open-source and closed-source projects. Then, we’ll break down a couple of standard workflows for different types of open-source projects, and look at where free security tools may (or may not) fit into a simple solution.</p>"

Collett,,,English,The Stories We Don't Tell,"<p>It’s easy to tell stories about people whose experience in the tech industry is unusual. Some of those stories are focused on innovators, but others are focused on ‘trailblazers’ from marginalised and under-represented groups. Articles like these often focus on the characteristics that these trailblazers exhibit - strength, perseverance, resilience. However, that’s only one part of the story. The ways in which under-represented people enter, experience, and hopefully thrive in our industry are far more complex.</p><p>Very few people advance their careers on positive attributes alone. For those from marginalised groups, their tech experience depends on the managers, companies, and communities who put in the time and effort to identify, employ, and sponsor them through their careers. Open-source communities have a role to play in this process; not only are they a frequent first point of contact for young folks and potential career-changers, they’re also a place where people are free to learn and make mistakes outside a formal employment structure, with the support of mentors and long-time community members.</p><p>In this talk, we’ll analyse what it means to be successful when nobody in the room looks like you, and break down the narrative of the trailblazers in the tech industry. Then, we’ll look at the role that technical groups and communities play in increasing diversity and fostering a sense of belonging in the industry. By the end of the session, you will have learned ways to use your energy to shape open-source communities where difference is both ordinary and celebrated, and also how you can start to translate that into a commercial workplace.</p>"

When a project hits crisis mode, often things will start to move very fast. Thinking about how you want to respond to emergencies and how you want to be seen at the end of the fiasco is worth thinking and talking about in advance. This talk is for folks who suspect that one day it could be their turn to handle a crisis and want to be as prepared as possible when it happens to them. These topics will be covered:</p><ul><li>Preserving your organization’s image</li><li>How to work together as a team</li><li>When to bring in a specialist</li><li>Learning from what happened</li></ul><p>Focusing on the big picture of your organization’s goals and thinking holistically about your relationships before you dive into the details, will help you free your mind from all the “what if we aren’t doing the right thing?” doubts that can creep in during crisis management. This talk will help you sort through your options so you can move forward and offer some advice on taking good care of your team-mates while things are tough. There are also some crucial actions to take as you get to the end of the current crisis that you’ll want to take care of before you declare things “finished!” so you can make sure you’re set up for future success.</p>"

But what do you do when there’s a problem with your workplace?</p><p>All workers, including tech workers, have the right to try and improve our workplaces. This talk will give you an overview of your rights, with a special focus on issues that commonly arise in the tech industry, such as workplace harassment, overuse of non-disclosure agreements and forced arbitration clauses, and misclassification of contractors. We’ll also talk about what you can do when your company does something unethical, following the “Bargaining for the Common Good” model used by workers around the country to fight poverty, systemic racism, and climate change.</p>"

This talk will provide an overview of software projects - most free/open source - which provide ways for governments, institutions, communities, and even groups of internet strangers to govern themselves and their resources in a more democratic way.</p>"

We start with the timeline of the attack that was determined by forensic analysis, cover what was damaged in the attack, and then cover the attack recovery process. Then we’ll discuss changes that were made to avoid and mitigate any future attacks. We wrap up with the lessons learned during this attack in the hope that they will help you to avoid and recover quicker if you do experience a ransomware attack.</p><p>After this talk you will have a better understanding of how an attack happens, what kind of alerts may be symptoms of an attack, what to do in case you are attacked, what happens after you are attacked, and what actions you can take now to avoid and mitigate a ransomware attack.</p>"

We aim to bring the benefits of computing freedom to all users. However, we often overlook an uncomfortable inequality: Software Freedom disproportionately empowers programmers and those wealthy enough to hire them.</p><p>For today’s average “end users”, freedomware leaves them with basically the same options as proprietary freeware: use it as-is, or politely ask the developer and hope for the best. In my opinion, this is a key reason why it’s difficult to convince the wider public to care; it’s why Software Freedom largely remains a movement by and for programmers.</p><p>In this talk, I’ll argue that:</p><ul><li>Programming education policy is the most important area for Software Freedom advocacy.</li><li>Designing for “nontechnical users” is an existential threat to Free Software.</li><li>Scriptable interfaces are a great way to make software more accessible to tech-illiterate users.</li></ul>"

As a result, the number of constituencies has ballooned: there are indie and corporate contributors and maintainers, open source software vendors, developers building proprietary code on top of open source, end-users who don’t know anything about software, people impacted by open source software who are not even using it, cloud providers, etc., etc.</p><p>When the interests of these different actors are in conflict, which one of them do we favor and why? Neither the Four Freedoms nor the Open Source Definition (OSD) really helps us answer that question.</p><p>Faced with similar issues, other communities have designed really effective frameworks to guide their decision-making processes. W3C’s “priority of constituencies” is such a framework.</p><p>In this talk we’ll dig into what W3C’s priority of constituencies is, outline its benefits, but also its limits.</p><p>We’ll then see how we could apply the priority of constituencies to open source, what that reveals about the complexity of the open source ecosystem, and in particular how the parts that are difficult to fit in such a framework are precisely those that have made the news in the past few years.</p>"
