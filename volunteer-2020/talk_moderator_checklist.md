Each volunteer time-slot is 45 minutes. The time break-down for those 45 minutes is:
- 0-5: Grace period to get to the talk
- 5-15: Join the call, ensure the speaker has everything they need, etc.
- 15-35: Moderate IRC channel, give time cues
- 35-45: Ask questions if there are any, give time cues.

## Before the Talk

- [ ] Join the call 10 minutes before the talk starts
- [ ] Ensure the speaker has joined. Ping Lucy on IRC if they haven't joined 7 minutes before talk
      starts. If I don't respond in 60 seconds, call me.
- [ ] Ask if they want to be introduced, plus pronunciation.
  - Introductions can be short and include as much details as the speaker wants. A basic one is just
    "Up next we have Jane Doe talking about FLOSS and you! Take it away Jane"
- [ ] Tell them you'll be giving verbal time cues, and ask if 5, 2, and 1 minutes works. If they
      aren't ok with verbal time cues, you can stop them at 20 minutes if there are questions or at 28
      minutes if there aren't any questions.
- [ ] Tell Lucy if a technician hasn't verified Speaker connection 4 minutes before the talk starts.
- [ ] Let the tech know you're ready to start the stream in `#seagl-volunteers`

## During the Talk

- [ ] Enforce Code of Conduct in IRC Channel. Escalate any violations to Lucy.
- [ ] Ensure the talk ends on time.
  - [ ] Give the speaker time cues at 5 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute from the soft-stop of their time (20 minutes).
  - **The video will auto-end after 31 minutes** - ensure the speaker has wrapped up any
    thoughts and Q&A by then.
  - [ ] Remind audience and speaker they can continue any conversations and ask any questions in the
    talk IRC channel, or make a new IRC channel using `!cr <topic>`
- [ ] Ask questions out loud to speaker from IRC if there is time for Q&A.
  - If the number of questions is overwhelming, ask what seem to be the most common questions.
    Remind people who's questions aren't answered they can create a topic channel using `!cr` in
chat and continue discussing the talk with the speaker there.
  - If there are no questions, the speaker can use the remaining time to continue speaking. If
    they're done talking, tell the technician in `#seagl-volunteers`
