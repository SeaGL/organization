We have an IRC bot named 'seagl-bot' that can help manage the conference in IRC. You can see what
commands are available by running `!help` in any channel that the bot is in (`#seagl-welcome` is a
good one to start in if you're not sure where to go). This is a list of the commands available as of
this writing:

```
!help
!schedule                       - Schedule for SeaGL 2020                         
!createroom (!cr): <room-name>  - Create channel and conference chat room         
!listrooms (!lr): <page-number> - List Conference chat rooms
