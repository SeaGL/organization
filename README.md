# SeaGL Organization Repo

This repo holds the public policies, processes, procedures, notes, and other files related to organizing the [Seattle GNU/Linux conference](http://seagl.org).

SeaGL has an existing Google Drive that contains a lot of our historical documents. Whenever possible, we'll try to link to the relevant docs here or transfer them over as time allows. We're a bunch of volunteers though, so be patient with us. :-)

## Committees

It takes a lot of committees to make a volunteer-run conference happen. Here are ours:

* [Programming & Flow](./program/README.md)
* [Finance](./media/README.md)
* [Attendee Experience](./onsite/README.md)
* [Promotion & Outreach](./outreach/README.md)
* Partnerships
* [SRE/Technical](./tech/README.md)
* Volunteers
* Inclusivity, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility (IDEA)
* Code of Conduct (CoC)

## Private files

Information that should not be public should be saved in the SeaGL Google Drive.

## Other repos

All website-related stuff lives in the [seagl.github.io](https://github.com/SeaGL/seagl.github.io) repository.

Our conference management software repository is at [seagl/osem](https://github.com/SeaGL/osem).
