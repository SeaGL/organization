# SeaGL Organization Repo

This repo holds miscellaneous files related to organizing the [Seattle GNU/Linux conference](http://seagl.org), and also pulls double-duty as an organization-wide issue tracker.

It used to also have a bunch of documentation, but that's been moved over to our [Nextcloud Collectives wiki](https://cloud.seagl.org/index.php/apps/collectives/p/JCPGykDcDS9JGBr/SeaGL%20wiki).

SeaGL has an existing Nextcloud folder that contains a lot of our historical documents. Whenever possible, we'll try to link to the relevant docs here or transfer them over to Nextcloud Collectives as time allows. We're a bunch of volunteers though, so be patient with us. :-)

## Committees

It takes a lot of committees to make a volunteer-run conference happen. You can read more about each committee, and maybe even get involved, [on this page](https://seagl.org/get_involved).

## Private files

Information that should not be public should be saved in the `SeaGL Private` Nextcloud group folder.

## Other repos

All website-related stuff lives in the [seagl.github.io](https://github.com/SeaGL/seagl.github.io) repository.

Our conference management software repository is at [seagl/pretalx](https://github.com/SeaGL/pretalx).
