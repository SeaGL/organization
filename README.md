# SeaGL Organization Repo

This repo holds the public policies, processes, procedures, notes, and other files related to organizing the [Seattle GNU/Linux conference](http://seagl.org).

## Committees

It takes a lot of committees to make a volunteer-run conference happen. Here are ours:

* [Financial](./financial/README.md)
* [Media](./media/README.md)
* [Program](./program/README.md)
* [Onsite](./onsite/README.md)
* [Outreach](./outreach/README.md)
* [Tech](./tech/README.md)

## Private files

Information that should not be public should be saved in the SeaGL Google Drive.

## Other repos

All website-related stuff lives in the [seagl.github.io](https://github.com/SeaGL/seagl.github.io) repository.

Our conference management software repository is at [seagl/osem](https://github.com/SeaGL/osem).
